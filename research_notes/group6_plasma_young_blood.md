## 6.1 Plasma Exchange and Parabiosis

### Scientific Foundation

**Heterochronic parabiosis:** The surgical joining of the circulatory systems of a young and an old animal. This technique, first used in aging research in the 1950s, has produced remarkable findings:

1. **Conboy et al. 2005 (landmark study):** Heterochronic parabiosis between young (2-3 month) and old (19-26 month) mice showed:
   - Old mice: Rejuvenation of muscle stem cells, liver progenitor cells, and neural stem cells
   - Young mice: Accelerated aging phenotypes
   - Published: Conboy IM, et al. *Nature*. 2005;433(7027):760-764. DOI: 10.1038/nature03260

2. **Villeda et al. 2014:** Young blood (or plasma) improved hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function in old mice
   - Published: Villeda SA, et al. *Nat Med*. 2014;20(6):659-663. DOI: 10.1038/nm.3569

3. **Key question:** Are the rejuvenating effects due to:
   a. **Pro-youth factors** in young blood that actively rejuvenate?
   b. **Pro-aging factors** in old blood that are diluted/removed?
   c. Both?

### Neutral Blood Exchange (Dilution Approach)

**Conboy lab breakthrough (2020):**

Irina and Michael Conboy's group at UC Berkeley demonstrated that simply **diluting old blood** (without adding young blood factors) was sufficient to rejuvenate multiple tissues:

| Study | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Mehdipour et al. 2020 | Neutral blood exchange (replacing 50% of old mouse plasma with saline + albumin) rejuvenated brain, liver, and muscle; reduced neuroinflammation; improved muscle regeneration; reduced fibrosis -- effects were comparable to heterochronic parabiosis | Mehdipour M, et al. Aging (Albany NY). 2020;12(10):8790-8819. DOI: 10.18632/aging.103418 |

**Implication:** The dominant mechanism may be REMOVAL of pro-aging factors rather than addition of pro-youth factors. This has profound translational implications because:
- Plasma exchange (therapeutic plasmapheresis) is already FDA-approved for other conditions
- No need to identify, produce, or deliver specific "youth factors"
- Much simpler and more immediately translatable than young blood transfusion

### Clinical Trials: Plasma Exchange for Aging

| NCT Number | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| NCT05575076 | Phase 2 [VERIFY] | Older adults (55-75 yrs) | Active [VERIFY] | Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for aging biomarkers; Dobri Kiprov, MD (San Francisco) [VERIFY] |
| Kiprov pilot study | Pilot | 8 participants (aged 55-75) | Completed [VERIFY] | 6 sessions of TPE over 3 weeks; measured epigenetic age, inflammatory markers, proteomic age | Kiprov DD, et al. [VERIFY publication] |

**Reported preliminary results from pilot plasma exchange studies:**
- Reductions in inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6)
- Improvements in proteomic aging biomarkers
- Possible reduction in epigenetic age (preliminary, small sample)
- Well-tolerated
- [VERIFY for peer-reviewed publication of results]

### 2023-2025 Developments

- Growing interest in "dilution" vs. "factor addition" debate
- Multiple groups exploring therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) as an aging intervention
- **Conboy lab follow-up studies:** Continued refinement of the neutral blood exchange approach; exploration of optimal dilution protocols [VERIFY]
- **Practical considerations for TPE as longevity therapy:**
  - TPE is invasive (requires IV access, 1-2 hour procedure)
  - Costs ~$1,000-3,000 per session
  - Requires multiple sessions (optimal frequency unknown)
  - Already FDA-approved and widely available in blood banks
  - Insurance does not cover TPE for "aging"
  - Some longevity clinics have begun offering TPE off-label [VERIFY]

### Safety of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange

TPE has extensive safety data from decades of clinical use for autoimmune conditions:
- **Common AEs:** Hypotension (5-10%), hypocalcemia (citrate anticoagulant chelates calcium), paresthesias, nausea
- **Serious AEs (rare):** Anaphylaxis to replacement fluid, air embolism, infection (IV access), severe hypotension
- **Contraindications:** Hemodynamic instability, severe coagulopathy, citrate allergy
- **Immunoglobulin depletion:** TPE removes IgG; increased infection risk with repeated exchanges unless supplemented
- **Overall:** Well-established safety profile for medical indication use; safety specifically for healthy aging adults undergoing repeated procedures needs further study

## 6.2 Alkahest / Grifols

### Company Profile

- **Alkahest:** Founded in 2014 by Tony Wyss-Coray (Stanford neuroscientist whose lab did pioneering parabiosis work)
- **Acquired by Grifols** (Spanish plasma products company) in 2020 for ~$146M
- **Core technology:** Identification and development of plasma-derived protein fractions that have rejuvenating properties

### Scientific Approach

Alkahest/Grifols' approach is based on Wyss-Coray's research identifying specific protein fractions in young plasma that mediate rejuvenating effects:

1. **Young plasma fractionation:** Systematically testing fractions of young plasma for biological activity
2. **Identification of active factors:** Using proteomics and functional assays to identify specific proteins responsible for rejuvenation
3. **Development of defined plasma fractions:** Rather than whole young plasma (which has regulatory and safety challenges), developing characterized protein mixtures

### Key Products/Pipeline

| Product | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| GRF6019 (PLASMA) | Plasma fraction depleted of coagulation factors and immunoglobulins; enriched for specific proteins | Phase 2 completed (Alzheimer's) |
| GRF6021 | Modified plasma fraction with enhanced rejuvenating activity | Preclinical [VERIFY] |

## 6.3 Elevian / GDF11

### Company Profile

- **Elevian:** Founded in 2017
- **Headquarters:** Boston, MA
- **Funding:** ~$70M+ raised [VERIFY]
- **Key founders:** Based on research from Lee Rubin and Amy Wagers labs at Harvard
- **Core technology:** Recombinant GDF11 (growth differentiation factor 11) and related circulating factors

### GDF11 Mechanism and Controversy

**GDF11 (Growth Differentiation Factor 11):**

GDF11 is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, closely related to myostatin (GDF8). It was initially proposed as a "rejuvenation factor" based on parabiosis studies:

**Pro-GDF11 evidence:**
| Study | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Loffredo et al. 2013 | GDF11 identified as circulating factor that declines with age; recombinant GDF11 reversed age-related cardiac hypertrophy in old mice | Loffredo FS, et al. Cell. 2013;153(4):828-39. DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.015 |
| Katsimpardi et al. 2014 | GDF11 improved cerebral vasculature and neurogenesis in aged mice | Katsimpardi L, et al. Science. 2014;344(6184):630-4. DOI: 10.1126/science.1251141 |
| Sinha et al. 2014 | GDF11 restored muscle stem cell function and muscle regeneration in aged mice | Sinha M, et al. Science. 2014;344(6184):649-52. DOI: 10.1126/science.1251152 |

**Anti-GDF11 / Controversy:**
| Study | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Egerman et al. 2015 | GDF11 does NOT decline with age when properly measured (earlier assay cross-reacted with GDF8/myostatin); GDF11 INHIBITS muscle regeneration (like myostatin) rather than promoting it | Egerman MA, et al. Cell Metab. 2015;22(1):164-74. DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.05.010 |
| Hinken et al. 2016 | Failed to replicate muscle rejuvenation with GDF11; high-dose GDF11 caused cachexia | [VERIFY exact citation] |
| Smith et al. 2015 | GDF11 levels do not change (or may increase) with age; raised questions about the original claims | Smith SC, et al. Cell Metab. 2015;22(1):54-6 |

**Current understanding (2023-2025):**
- The GDF11 field remains controversial
- The original assays used by the Harvard group had cross-reactivity issues with GDF8 (myostatin), which complicated interpretation
- Some biological effects of GDF11 appear real (cardiac, vascular) but the muscle regeneration claims are disputed
- GDF11 and GDF8 have ~90% sequence similarity and share the same receptor (ActRIIB); effects are dose-dependent and context-specific
- Whether GDF11 truly declines with age is still debated

### Elevian Pipeline and Status

- **rGDF11:** Recombinant GDF11 protein therapy
- **Target indications:** Stroke, heart failure, cognitive decline, metabolic disease
- Elevian has published some preclinical data on rGDF11 in stroke and cardiac models [VERIFY specific publications]
- **No clinical trials registered** for aging indications as of early 2025 [VERIFY]
- IND-enabling studies reportedly underway for stroke or cardiac indication [VERIFY]

### 2023-2025 Developments

- Elevian continued preclinical development despite the controversy surrounding GDF11 biology
- The company appears to be pursuing disease-specific indications (stroke, heart failure) rather than "aging" per se
- Academic debate about GDF11 biology continues without clear resolution
- Some groups have identified other circulating factors (TIMP2, CCL11 as pro-aging, GDF15 as ambiguous) that may be more relevant than GDF11

### Safety Considerations

- **GDF11 = muscle wasting risk:** Given its similarity to myostatin, GDF11 at high doses could cause cachexia/muscle wasting
- **Dose-response concerns:** The therapeutic window between beneficial and harmful doses may be narrow
- **TGF-beta superfamily risks:** Fibrosis, immunomodulation, effects on reproductive tissues
- **No human safety data** as of early 2025
