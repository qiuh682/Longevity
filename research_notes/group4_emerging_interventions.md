## 4.1 Taurine

### Mechanism of Action

Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a conditionally essential amino acid found abundantly in bile, the lower intestine, and many tissues (heart, brain, retina, muscle, blood cells). Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in the body.

**Proposed anti-aging mechanisms (identified largely from Singh et al. 2023):**

1. **Anti-inflammatory:** Taurine suppresses NF-kB signaling, reduces TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta production; modulates macrophage polarization toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype
2. **Antioxidant:** Taurine stabilizes cell membranes, scavenges hypochlorous acid (HOCl), reduces mitochondrial ROS through stabilization of ETC complexes
3. **Telomerase/telomere protection:** Singh et al. 2023 showed taurine deficiency is associated with telomere shortening; supplementation protected telomere length in mice
4. **Cellular senescence reduction:** Taurine reduced the number of senescent cells (p16+ and p21+) in multiple tissues in aged mice
5. **Mitochondrial function:** Taurine is incorporated into mitochondrial tRNA as taurine modifications (5-taurinomethyluridine), essential for proper mitochondrial translation and ETC function
6. **Stem cell maintenance:** Taurine improved intestinal stem cell function in aged mice
7. **DNA damage repair:** Taurine enhanced DNA damage response pathways
8. **Metabolic regulation:** Improved glucose tolerance, reduced insulin resistance, reduced obesity
9. **Epigenetic effects:** Taurine deficiency was associated with accelerated epigenetic aging; supplementation partially reversed this

### Key Preclinical Results

**The Singh et al. 2023 study is the landmark paper:**

| Study | Species | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Singh P et al. 2023 | Mouse, Monkey, Worm, Human (observational) | **LANDMARK:** Taurine levels decline with age in mice, monkeys, and humans (by ~80% from youth to old age). Taurine supplementation in middle-aged mice: extended median lifespan by 10-12% (sex-dependent); increased bone density; improved muscle function; reduced body fat; improved glucose tolerance; reduced cellular senescence; reduced DNA damage; reduced inflammation; improved gut, brain, bone, muscle, immune function. In C. elegans: extended lifespan. In monkeys: improved bone density, metabolic markers (6-month study). In humans (observational): lower taurine associated with higher BMI, inflammation, T2DM risk | Singh P, Gollapalli K, Mangiola S, et al. Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging. Science. 2023;380(6649):eabn9257. DOI: 10.1126/science.abn9257 |
| Ito et al. 2014 | Mouse | Taurine-depleted mice (taurine transporter KO) showed accelerated aging phenotypes: shortened lifespan, muscle wasting, cardiac dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity | Ito T, et al. Adv Exp Med Biol. 2015;803:481-7 |

**Lifespan data (Singh et al. 2023):**
- **Male mice:** Taurine (1000 mg/kg/day in water, starting at 14 months) extended median lifespan by ~10% (p<0.05)
- **Female mice:** Extended median lifespan by ~12% (p<0.05)
- **Maximum lifespan:** Also extended in both sexes
- **C. elegans:** Extended lifespan (percentage not specified precisely in abstract)
- **Monkeys:** No lifespan data (6-month intervention only), but improved bone density and metabolic markers

### Clinical Trial Status (as of early 2025)

| NCT Number | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| NCT05820919 | Phase 2 [VERIFY] | Healthy older adults (60+) | Recruiting [VERIFY] | Taurine supplementation for aging biomarkers; Columbia University [VERIFY] |
| Various | N/A | Exercise performance | Various | Multiple small taurine + exercise studies |

**No large-scale RCT for longevity/aging has been completed as of early 2025.** The Singh et al. 2023 paper was published in June 2023, and clinical trials are still being designed and initiated.

**2023-2025 developments:**
- The Singh et al. 2023 Science paper generated enormous interest in taurine as a longevity intervention
- Multiple groups began designing human aging trials
- Taurine supplement sales increased dramatically after the publication
- Several observational/epidemiological analyses correlating taurine levels with aging outcomes were published or in progress [VERIFY]
- The Columbia University group (led by Vijay Yadav, senior author on Singh et al.) is leading clinical translation efforts [VERIFY]

### Safety/Adverse Event Profile

- **Extremely well-characterized safety profile:** Taurine has been used in energy drinks (Red Bull contains ~1000mg/can) and supplements for decades
- EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) considers taurine safe at doses up to 6000 mg/day
- **Common AEs:** Essentially none at typical supplementation doses (500-3000 mg/day)
- **High-dose safety:** Doses up to 6g/day have been studied in clinical contexts (heart failure, cystic fibrosis) with no significant adverse effects
- **No hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or cardiovascular toxicity** at any studied dose
- **Drug interactions:** Minimal; taurine is not metabolized by CYP enzymes
- **Cost:** Very inexpensive ($5-15/month for 1-3g/day as supplement)
- **Key safety advantage:** One of the safest longevity candidates; essentially no known risks at proposed anti-aging doses

### Controversies and Limitations

- **Single landmark study:** The Singh et al. 2023 paper is a tour de force, but it is essentially one study (albeit multi-species). Independent replication of the lifespan extension is needed.
- **ITP has not tested taurine:** NIA Interventions Testing Program testing would provide independent verification [VERIFY if ITP has added taurine]
- **Dose translation uncertainty:** The mouse dose (1000 mg/kg/day) translates to a very high human dose (~60-80g/day by simple body weight scaling, or ~5-8g/day by allometric scaling). The optimal human dose is unknown.
- **Correlation vs. causation in humans:** The human observational data (lower taurine = more disease) cannot establish causation
- **Mechanism complexity:** Taurine has so many proposed mechanisms that it is difficult to identify which are truly causal for the lifespan extension

## 4.2 GlyNAC (Glycine + N-Acetylcysteine)

### Mechanism of Action

GlyNAC is a combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which together serve as precursors to glutathione (GSH) -- the body's primary endogenous antioxidant.

**Glutathione synthesis:**
```
Glutamate + Cysteine → [GCL] → gamma-glutamylcysteine + Glycine → [GS] → Glutathione (GSH)
```

- **NAC** provides cysteine (the rate-limiting amino acid for GSH synthesis)
- **Glycine** provides the other rate-limiting amino acid (glycine deficiency is common in aging)
- Together, they restore age-depleted GSH levels more effectively than either alone

**Age-related GSH decline:** GSH levels decline 30-50% with aging due to:
- Reduced cysteine and glycine availability
- Decreased GCL and GS enzyme activity
- Increased oxidative consumption of GSH
- Reduced recycling (GSH reductase activity decreases)

**Downstream effects of GSH restoration (proposed anti-aging mechanisms):**
1. **Oxidative stress reduction:** GSH is the primary intracellular antioxidant; restoration reduces oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids
2. **Mitochondrial function:** GSH is critical for mitochondrial redox balance; restoration improves ETC function and reduces mitochondrial ROS
3. **Genomic stability:** Reduced oxidative DNA damage; improved DNA repair capacity
4. **Inflammation reduction:** GSH modulates NF-kB; oxidative stress drives inflammaging
5. **Insulin sensitivity:** Oxidative stress impairs insulin signaling; GSH restoration improves insulin sensitivity
6. **Immune function:** GSH is essential for T-cell function, which declines with age
7. **Endothelial function:** GSH protects endothelial cells from oxidative damage
8. **Glycine-specific effects:** Glycine also acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, anti-inflammatory (glycine receptor-mediated), and collagen synthesis substrate

### Key Preclinical and Clinical Results

**The GlyNAC aging research is primarily from Rajagopal Sekhar's lab at Baylor College of Medicine:**

| Study | Design | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Sekhar et al. 2011 | Human pilot, 8 elderly + 8 young | GlyNAC (100mg/kg/day each) x 14 days restored GSH levels in elderly to youthful levels; improved markers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial fuel oxidation, body composition | Sekhar RV, et al.

Benefits reversed 12 weeks after stopping. | Kumar P, et al. Clin Transl Med. 2021;11(3):e372. DOI: 10.1002/ctm2.372 |
| Kumar et al. 2023 | RCT, n=72 (36 GlyNAC, 36 placebo), 16 weeks | **LARGER CONFIRMATORY STUDY:** In older adults (61-80 yrs), GlyNAC improved 8 of 12 hallmarks of aging: oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, genomic damage, cognition, muscle strength, gait speed, exercise capacity | Kumar P, et al. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2023;78(1):75-89. DOI: 10.1093/gerona/glac135 |

### Clinical Trial Status (as of early 2025)

| NCT Number | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| NCT01870193 | N/A | Elderly (61-80 yrs) | Completed | Kumar et al. 2021 pilot study |
| NCT03462680 | Phase 2 | Older adults (61-80 yrs) | Completed | Kumar et al. 2023 larger RCT |

- No ITP testing of GlyNAC as of early 2025 [VERIFY]

### Safety/Adverse Event Profile

- **Very well-tolerated** in all published studies
- Both glycine and NAC have extensive safety records as individual supplements/drugs
- **NAC:** FDA-approved drug (mucolytic, acetaminophen overdose antidote); well-tolerated at 600-1800 mg/day; GI side effects (nausea) at higher doses; theoretical concern about reducing efficacy of some chemotherapy drugs
- **Glycine:** GRAS status; no significant AEs at 3-15g/day
- **Combined GlyNAC:** No additional safety signals beyond individual components
- **Cost:** Very affordable (~$15-30/month for supplement-grade GlyNAC)
- **No hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or cardiovascular toxicity reported**

DOI: 10.1093/gerona/glac135

### Controversies and Limitations

- **Single lab:** Nearly all GlyNAC aging data comes from one research group (Sekhar lab at Baylor). Independent replication is essential.
- **Small sample sizes:** Largest RCT had 72 participants; much larger trials are needed.
- **Short duration:** 16 weeks is insufficient to assess effects on age-related disease incidence or mortality.
- **No lifespan data:** No animal lifespan study with GlyNAC combination published.
- **Active metabolite uncertainty:** Is the benefit from glutathione restoration specifically, or from glycine and/or NAC effects independent of GSH?
- **Benefits reversed after stopping:** The Kumar et al. 2021 study showed benefits reversed 12 weeks after discontinuation, suggesting chronic supplementation is needed.

## 4.3 Spermidine

### Mechanism of Action

Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine found in all living cells. Dietary sources include wheat germ, soybeans, mushrooms, aged cheese, and fermented foods.

**Primary mechanism -- autophagy induction:**

1. **EP300/CBP acetyltransferase inhibition:** Spermidine directly inhibits EP300 (p300) acetyltransferase, which leads to:
   - Deacetylation of multiple autophagy-related proteins (ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, Beclin-1, LC3)
   - Hypoacetylation activates autophagy initiation
2. **TFEB nuclear translocation:** Spermidine promotes TFEB (transcription factor EB) activation, enhancing lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression
3. **AMPK activation:** Indirect AMPK activation promotes autophagy via ULK1
4. **mTORC1 modulation:** Some evidence of mTORC1 suppression

**Additional anti-aging mechanisms:**
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Reduces NF-kB, IL-6, TNF-alpha; modulates NLRP3 inflammasome
- **Cardioprotective:** Improves cardiac autophagy, reduces cardiac hypertrophy, improves diastolic function
- **Neuroprotective:** Enhances neuronal autophagy, reduces protein aggregation, improves memory
- **Epigenetic effects:** Polyamines influence histone acetylation status broadly
- **Telomere maintenance:** Some evidence of telomere protection [VERIFY]
- **Gut health:** Spermidine supports intestinal barrier integrity

### Key Preclinical Results

Am J Clin Nutr. 2018;108(2):371-380. DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/nqy102 |

**Lifespan data:**
- Yeast: 3-4x lifespan extension (chronological)
- C. elegans: ~15% lifespan extension
- Drosophila: ~30% lifespan extension
- Mouse: ~10% median lifespan extension (Eisenberg et al. 2016)
- Human epidemiological: ~5-year difference in mortality between highest and lowest dietary spermidine quintiles (Kiechl et al. 2018)

### Clinical Trial Status (as of early 2025)

| NCT Number | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| NCT03094546 | Phase 2 (SmartAge) | Older adults (60-90) with subjective cognitive decline | Completed | Spermidine-rich wheat germ extract x 3 months; improved memory performance; published |

- Combination studies (spermidine + other autophagy activators) in preclinical models [VERIFY]
- ITP has not tested spermidine as of early 2025 [VERIFY]

### Safety/Adverse Event Profile

- **Excellent safety profile:** Spermidine is a natural dietary component consumed daily
- No serious AEs reported in clinical trials at doses equivalent to 1-6 mg/day (wheat germ extract)
- Minimal GI side effects
- **Theoretical concerns:**
  - Polyamines can support cancer cell proliferation; however, epidemiological data shows inverse association with cancer mortality
  - High-dose polyamine supplementation in the context of active malignancy is theoretically risky
- **Drug interactions:** Minimal known interactions
- **Cost:** $30-60/month for supplement formulations

## 4.4 Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG)

### Mechanism of Action

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG, also known as 2-oxoglutarate) is a key intermediate in the TCA (Krebs) cycle and a critical cofactor for multiple enzymes involved in aging.

**Key enzymatic roles relevant to aging:**

1. **TET demethylases (TET1/2/3):** AKG is an essential cofactor for TET enzymes that oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), initiating DNA demethylation. Age-related decline in AKG could impair TET function and contribute to epigenetic drift.

2. **Jumonji-domain histone demethylases (JHDMs):** AKG is required for histone demethylation; AKG decline could alter histone methylation patterns with aging.

3. **Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs):** AKG is a cofactor for PHDs that regulate HIF-1alpha stability; this connects to oxygen sensing and metabolic regulation.

4. **Collagen synthesis:** Prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases (essential for collagen maturation) require AKG as a cofactor.

5. **mTOR modulation:** AKG inhibits ATP synthase and reduces cellular ATP levels, which activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR.

6. **Autophagy promotion:** Via mTOR inhibition and AMPK activation.

7. **Anti-inflammatory:** AKG suppresses NF-kB and reduces IL-6 production.

8. **Metabolic regulation:** As a TCA cycle intermediate, AKG levels reflect and modulate cellular energy status.

**Calcium-AKG (CaAKG):** The commercially available supplement form that provides both calcium and AKG.

### Key Preclinical Results

| Study | Species | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Asadi Shahmirzadi et al. 2020 | Mouse | CaAKG (2% in diet) started at 18 months extended median lifespan by 12% (female) and reduced frailty; compressed morbidity (shorter period of decline before death); reduced epigenetic age (Horvath mouse clock) | Asadi Shahmirzadi A, et al. Cell Metab. 2020;32(3):447-456.e6. DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2020.08.004 |
| Chin et al. 2014 | C. elegans | AKG extended C. elegans lifespan by ~50% via ATP synthase inhibition and TOR pathway modulation | Chin RM, et al. Nature. 2014;510(7505):397-401. DOI: 10.1038/nature13264 |
| Su et al. 2019 | Drosophila | AKG supplementation extended Drosophila lifespan and improved age-related decline | Su Y, et al. Aging (Albany NY). 2019;11(13):4482-4499 |

**Lifespan data:**
- C. elegans: ~50% lifespan extension (Chin et al. 2014)
- Drosophila: Significant extension (magnitude varies by study)
- Mouse: ~12% median lifespan extension in females (Asadi Shahmirzadi et al. 2020); morbidity compression (healthier until closer to death)

### Clinical Trial Status (as of early 2025)

| NCT Number | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| NCT05271903 | Phase 2 [VERIFY] | Healthy middle-aged adults (40-65) | Active [VERIFY] | CaAKG supplementation; aging biomarkers; PI: Brian Kennedy [VERIFY] |
| NCT04848461 | N/A [VERIFY] | Older adults | Completed [VERIFY] | CaAKG (Rejuvant) effect on biological age (TruAge test) |

**Preliminary human data:**
- A 2021 study (non-peer-reviewed / company-sponsored) by Rejuvant (the CaAKG supplement brand, associated with the Buck Institute) reported that CaAKG supplementation reduced biological age by an average of 8 years (measured by TruAge DNA methylation test) in a 7-month trial of middle-aged adults. This study has been criticized for:
  - Small sample size
  - No placebo control (later versions may have added controls)
  - Use of a proprietary epigenetic clock (TruAge) rather than independently validated clocks
  - Company conflict of interest (Rejuvant/Ponce de Leon Health)
  - [VERIFY for peer-reviewed publication of these results]

### 2023-2025 Developments

- Growing commercial availability of CaAKG supplements (Rejuvant brand)
- Brian Kennedy (formerly Buck Institute, now at National University of Singapore) continues to lead AKG aging research
- Additional clinical trials evaluating CaAKG with validated epigenetic clocks [VERIFY]
- Some groups exploring AKG in combination with other interventions (e.g., AKG + NMN, AKG + metformin) [VERIFY]
- ITP has not tested AKG [VERIFY]

### Safety/Adverse Event Profile

- **Very well-tolerated:** AKG is a naturally occurring metabolite
- CaAKG supplements: no significant AEs reported at doses of 1-2g/day
- **Possible GI effects** at high doses (mild nausea, stomach discomfort)
- **Calcium load:** CaAKG provides supplemental calcium; consideration in patients with hypercalcemia or kidney stones
- Long-term safety data limited (most studies <12 months)
- GRAS status for food use

### Controversies

- **Single mouse lifespan study** with limited replication
- **Sex-specific effects:** The Asadi Shahmirzadi et al. 2020 study showed lifespan extension primarily in females, with less clear effects in males
- **Commercial conflicts:** The Rejuvant/Ponce de Leon Health connection to researchers raises concerns about bias
- **Unvalidated human data:** The biological age reduction claims using proprietary clocks need independent verification with validated tools (GrimAge, DunedinPACE)
