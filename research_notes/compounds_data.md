## 1. SENOLYTICS

Senolytics are compounds that selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells by targeting the senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs). Senescent cells accumulate with age and secrete a pro-inflammatory secretome (SASP) that drives tissue dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and age-related disease.

### 1.1 Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q)

#### Mechanism of Action

Dasatinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor originally developed as a BCR-ABL inhibitor for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the senolytic context, it targets dependence receptor tyrosine kinases and Src family kinases upregulated in senescent cells, preferentially eliminating senescent human preadipocytes by inhibiting ephrin-dependent survival signaling.

Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid that inhibits PI3K, serpine (PAI-1/2), BCL-2/BCL-xL anti-apoptotic pathways, and HIF-1alpha. Together, D+Q exploits the pro-survival networks that senescent cells rely on:

- **Dasatinib targets:** Tyrosine kinases (ephrin receptors, Src family), more effective against senescent preadipocytes
- **Quercetin targets:** BCL-2 family proteins, PI3K/AKT, serpines, more effective against senescent endothelial cells and bone marrow stem cells
- **Synergy:** The combination covers a broader spectrum of senescent cell types than either agent alone

The typical dosing regimen is intermittent ("hit-and-run"): short courses of 3 consecutive days separated by weeks to months, reflecting the hypothesis that senescent cells take weeks to reaccumulate after clearance.

**Typical clinical dosing:** Dasatinib 100 mg + Quercetin 1000-1250 mg, given for 3 consecutive days every 2-4 weeks.

### 1.2 Fisetin

#### Mechanism of Action

Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a naturally occurring polyphenol flavonoid found in strawberries, apples, persimmons, onions, and cucumbers. It is the most potent senolytic flavonoid identified in screening studies. Its senolytic activity operates through multiple mechanisms:

1. **BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibition:** Directly binds and inhibits anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, the critical survival factors for senescent cells
2. **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition:** Suppresses pro-survival signaling
3. **NF-kB suppression:** Reduces inflammatory SASP factor production
4. **p53 stabilization:** Promotes apoptosis in damaged cells
5. **SIRT1 activation:** Enhances NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity
6. **Nrf2 activation:** Upregulates antioxidant response element genes

Fisetin was identified as the most potent senolytic flavonoid in a screen of 10 flavonoids by Yousefzadeh et al. (2018), showing approximately 50% greater senolytic potency than quercetin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

#### Preclinical Evidence

### 1.3 Navitoclax (ABT-263)

#### Mechanism of Action

Navitoclax is a small-molecule BH3 mimetic that inhibits BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w anti-apoptotic proteins. Originally developed by AbbVie/Abbott for cancer therapy, its potent senolytic activity derives from the critical dependence of senescent cells on BCL-2/BCL-xL for survival.

**Detailed mechanism:**
1. Navitoclax binds the hydrophobic groove of BCL-2/BCL-xL/BCL-w with high affinity (Ki < 1 nM)
2. This displaces pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (BIM, BAD, PUMA)
3. Freed BH3-only proteins activate BAX and BAK
4. BAX/BAK oligomerize on the outer mitochondrial membrane, forming pores
5. Cytochrome c release triggers the caspase cascade and apoptosis
6. Senescent cells are preferentially killed due to elevated BCL-2/BCL-xL expression as part of the SCAP network

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Species | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Zhu et al. 2016 | Mouse | Selectively killed senescent HUVECs and IMR90 fibroblasts; reduced senescent cell burden; improved hematopoietic stem cell function | Zhu Y, et al. *Aging Cell*. 2016;15(3):428-35. DOI: 10.1111/acel.12445 |

| Glioma/DMG models (2025) | Mouse | Effective in glioma and diffuse midline glioma (DMG) models | 2025 publication |

#### Clinical Trial Status

- **No dedicated aging/longevity clinical trials** registered as of early 2025
- Extensive clinical history in oncology (CLL, lymphoma, myelofibrosis)
- The 2024-2025 focus has been on topical/local delivery strategies to avoid systemic thrombocytopenia
- Prodrug strategies (Nav-Gal, PZ-15227) are being developed for improved therapeutic windows

#### Safety Profile

**Major dose-limiting toxicity:**
- **Thrombocytopenia:** BCL-xL is essential for platelet survival; inhibition causes accelerated platelet apoptosis. This is the primary obstacle to aging indication development.
- Neutropenia (less common)

**Other AEs (from oncology trials):** nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, back pain, peripheral edema

### 1.4 UBX1325 / Foselutoclax (Unity Biotechnology)

#### Mechanism of Action

UBX1325 (foselutoclax) is a small-molecule BCL-xL inhibitor developed by Unity Biotechnology specifically for intravitreal (eye) injection. By delivering the drug directly to the eye, systemic exposure and thrombocytopenia are minimized. UBX1325 selectively eliminates senescent cells in diabetic retinal blood vessels, targeting senescent retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes that accumulate in the diabetic retina and contribute to vascular leak, inflammation, and neurodegeneration through SASP factor secretion.

#### Preclinical Evidence

- Selectively killed senescent human retinal pigment epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and Muller glia in vitro
- In mouse models of retinal degeneration, intravitreal UBX1325 reduced senescent cell burden, decreased SASP factors (VEGF, IL-6, IL-8), and improved retinal function (ERG)
- Single intravitreal injection provided durable effects lasting weeks
- No significant retinal toxicity at therapeutic doses (rabbit, non-human primate safety studies)

#### Clinical Trial Status

| Study | Phase | Condition | Status | Key Results |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1 (NCT04537884) | Phase 1 | DME | Completed | Single ascending dose; n=18; well-tolerated; no dose-limiting toxicities |
| Phase 2b ASPIRE | Phase 2b | DME | Completed | **Key result:** 5.6 more ETDRS letters vs sham at week 48 (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7); statistically significant, clinically meaningful; 48-week durability from single injection |
| NEJM Evidence | -- | -- | Published | Results published in *NEJM Evidence* |

**ASPIRE trial highlights:**
- Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity
- Remarkable 48-week durability from a single injection
- No treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to discontinuation
- No systemic thrombocytopenia (confirming local delivery avoids systemic BCL-xL inhibition)

**Company update:** Unity Biotechnology secured $55M Series C funding led by Foresite Capital (2024), indicating continued investment in the program.

#### Safety Profile

- No dose-limiting toxicities in Phase 1
- No TEAEs leading to discontinuation in Phase 2b
- No systemic thrombocytopenia
- Injection-related AEs only (conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain -- common with any intravitreal injection)
- Overall favorable safety profile

## 2. mTOR PATHWAY MODULATORS

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central nutrient-sensing kinase that regulates cell growth, protein synthesis, autophagy, and metabolism. mTOR inhibition is the most robustly replicated pharmacological lifespan extension intervention in mammals.

---

### 2.1 Rapamycin / Sirolimus

#### Mechanism of Action

Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a macrolide compound produced by *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*, originally discovered on Easter Island (Rapa Nui). It is the canonical inhibitor of mTORC1 and mimics caloric restriction signaling.

**Detailed mechanism:**
1. Rapamycin binds intracellular protein FKBP12
2. The rapamycin-FKBP12 complex binds the FRB domain of mTOR, specifically inhibiting mTORC1
3. Downstream effects:
   - **Suppresses S6K1/S6K2:** Reduces protein synthesis and cell growth
   - **Activates autophagy:** De-represses ULK1 complex, enhancing cellular quality control
   - **Inhibits cap-dependent translation:** Via 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation
   - **Activates TFEB:** Nuclear translocation, promoting lysosomal biogenesis
   - **Modulates immune function:** Can enhance some immune responses at low doses while immunosuppressive at high doses
   - **Reduces SASP:** Senomorphic activity via mTORC1 suppression in senescent cells

4. Chronic high-dose rapamycin also partially inhibits mTORC2, which impairs AKT signaling and may cause insulin resistance.

**Rapamycin + acarbose combination:** Achieved a 36.6% increase in median lifespan in mice, one of the largest pharmacological lifespan extensions recorded.

**Oxford study finding:** Low-dose rapamycin reduces senescent cells, adding senolytic-adjacent activity to its portfolio.

**PEARL Trial Results (PMC12074816):**
- 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT
- 114 healthy adults aged 50-85
- 5mg or 10mg compounded rapamycin weekly vs placebo
- **Safe and well-tolerated** overall
- **Women on 10mg:** Improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain
- **5mg group:** Improved emotional well-being and general health
- **Important limitation:** Compounded rapamycin had approximately 1/3 the concentration of commercial formulations, potentially underestimating effects

**2025 review (Aging journal):** A comprehensive review concluded there is "no clear clinical evidence" that benefits demonstrated in preclinical models translate to humans yet, highlighting the need for larger and longer trials.

#### Safety Profile

**Low-dose/intermittent longevity context:**
- At doses being explored for longevity (1-10 mg weekly), many side effects appear reduced or absent
- Low-dose rapamycin may actually *enhance* certain immune responses rather than suppress them
- Mouth ulcers remain the most commonly reported side effect even at low doses
- Hyperlipidemia may occur but is typically manageable
- PEARL trial confirmed safety and tolerability at 5mg and 10mg weekly doses

**Standard dose risks (transplant/oncology):** immunosuppression, hyperlipidemia, impaired wound healing, stomatitis, insulin resistance, interstitial lung disease (rare)

### 2.2 Everolimus (RAD001)

#### Mechanism of Action

Everolimus is a synthetic rapamycin analog ("rapalog") with improved oral bioavailability and shorter half-life (~30 hours vs ~60 hours for rapamycin). Like rapamycin, it forms a complex with FKBP12 to inhibit mTORC1. The mechanism is essentially identical.

#### Preclinical Evidence

The preclinical aging data for everolimus largely mirrors rapamycin. The primary everolimus-specific contribution comes from clinical studies of immune aging.

#### Clinical Trial Status

| NCT Number / Study | Phase | Condition | Status | Key Details |
|---------------------|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Mannick et al. 2014 (NCT01227135) | Phase 2 | Immune aging | Completed | **LANDMARK:** 218 healthy older adults; 0.5mg/day or 5mg weekly --> 20% increase in immune titers |
| Phase 2b with RTB101 | Phase 2b | Enhanced immune function | Completed | Combination for reduced respiratory infections |
| NCT05835999 (EVERLAST) | N/A | Low-dose in older adults | Active | Completion expected late 2026 |

**Mannick et al. 2014 Key Results (PMID: 25540326):**
- 218 healthy older adults (>=65 years)
- Low-dose everolimus (0.5mg/day and 5mg weekly) enhanced influenza vaccine response by approximately 20%
- Reduced PD-1+ CD4 and CD8 T cells, associated with enhanced T-cell function
- This was groundbreaking: an mTOR inhibitor *improved* immune function in the elderly

**Mannick et al. 2018:**
- Combined low-dose everolimus with RTB101
- 264 elderly volunteers
- Reduced respiratory tract infections by 30.6%

#### Safety Profile

- Well-tolerated at low doses in both 2014 and 2018 studies
- Most common AE: mouth ulcers (dose-dependent, ~2-10% at low doses)
- No significant immunosuppression at low doses
- Mild hyperlipidemia in some participants
- At full oncology doses (10mg/day), similar side effect profile to rapamycin

### 2.3 RTB101 (resTORbio / Antos)

#### Mechanism of Action

RTB101 is a catalytic inhibitor of TORC1 (as opposed to the allosteric inhibition by rapamycin). It directly inhibits the mTOR kinase catalytic site. The proposed advantage was preferential mTORC1 inhibition while sparing mTORC2, potentially avoiding insulin resistance.

Originally derived from dactolisib (BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor developed by Novartis for oncology).

#### Clinical Trial Status

**Phase 2b (Mannick et al. 2018):**
- RTB101 10mg + everolimus 0.5mg daily
- 264 elderly volunteers, 16 weeks
- Reduced clinically symptomatic respiratory tract infections by 30.6% (p = 0.008)

**Phase 3 PROTECTOR trial (NCT03693612):**
- RTB101 alone (10mg daily) vs placebo
- ~652 elderly volunteers
- **RESULT: FAILED** -- RTB101 monotherapy did not significantly reduce respiratory infections (November 2019)
- resTORbio's stock dropped ~75%

**Current status:** resTORbio/Antos was acquired; program status is unclear as of 2025. The investigators (Joan Mannick, Chen Schor) co-founded Tornado Therapeutics (2022) to continue refined mTOR inhibitor strategies.

## 3. NAD+ PRECURSORS AND MODULATORS

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a critical coenzyme that declines approximately 50% between ages 40 and 60. This decline is driven by increased CD38 expression, increased PARP activity, and decreased NAMPT expression. Restoring NAD+ levels is a major therapeutic target in aging research.

---

### 3.1 NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)

#### Mechanism of Action

NMN is a direct biosynthetic precursor to NAD+, converted in a single enzymatic step by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs):

```
Nicotinamide (NAM) --> [NAMPT] --> NMN --> [NMNAT1/2/3] --> NAD+
```

NAD+ serves as:
- **Redox cofactor:** Electron carrier in glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation
- **Sirtuin substrate:** Consumed by SIRT1-7 deacetylases regulating DNA repair, mitochondrial function, inflammation, metabolism
- **PARP substrate:** Consumed by PARP1/2 for DNA damage repair
- **CD38/CD157 substrate:** Degraded by these ectoenzymes, which increase with age

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Species | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Mills et al. 2016 | Mouse | 12-month NMN suppressed age-related weight gain, enhanced energy metabolism, improved insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, eye function | Mills KF, et al. *Cell Metab*. 2016;24(6):795-806. DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.013 |
| Yoshino et al. 2011 | Mouse | NMN restored NAD+ in diabetic mice, improved glucose tolerance | Yoshino J, et al. *Cell Metab*. 2011;14(4):528-36 |
| de Picciotto et al. 2016 | Mouse | NMN improved vascular endothelial function, reduced aortic stiffness | de Picciotto NE, et al. *Aging Cell*. 2016;15(3):522-30 |

**Lifespan data:** No published study has demonstrated significant lifespan extension with NMN in mice. Most studies focus on healthspan metrics.

#### Clinical Trial Status

| NCT Number / Study | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|---------------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Yoshino et al. 2021 (NCT03151239) | Phase 1 | Postmenopausal prediabetic women | Completed | 250 mg/day x 10 weeks; improved muscle insulin sensitivity |
| Feb 2025 trial | N/A | Adults | Completed | 350mg/day for 4 weeks; liposomal NMN significantly increased NAD+ vs non-liposomal |
| 2024 older adults (n=60) | N/A | Older adults | Completed | 12 weeks NMN --> improved walking speed, sleep quality. PMID: 38789831 |
| Jan 2024 Japanese study | N/A | 14 healthy middle-aged men | Completed | Oral NMN augments NAD+ metabolism |
| NCT07144527 | N/A | N/A | Ongoing | Additional evaluation |
| GeroScience 2022 | N/A | Healthy middle-aged adults | Published | Multicenter RCT showing efficacy and safety |

**Meta-analysis findings (8 RCTs, 250-2000mg/day):** No significant benefit on fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or lipid profile in pooled analysis.

**2025 meta-analysis:** Minimal benefits for sarcopenia and muscle performance in older adults. NMN and NR offer minimal benefits for muscle mass/function in adults over 60.

#### Safety Profile

- Generally well-tolerated across all published trials at doses up to 1200 mg/day
- No serious adverse events attributed to NMN
- Most common AEs: mild GI symptoms (nausea, bloating), headache
- Long-term safety data (>12 weeks) remains limited
- Theoretical cancer concern: increased NAD+ could fuel cancer cell metabolism, though NMN also enhances DNA repair and immune surveillance

### 3.2 NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)

#### Mechanism of Action

NR is an NAD+ precursor converted to NMN by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1/NRK2), then to NAD+ by NMNATs:

```
NR --> [NRK1/NRK2] --> NMN --> [NMNAT] --> NAD+
```

NR requires one additional enzymatic step compared to NMN. It crosses cell membranes via ENT (equilibrative nucleoside transporter) channels and has clearly established oral bioavailability.

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Species | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Zhang et al. 2016 | Mouse | NR replenished NAD+ in aged mice; improved mitochondrial and stem cell function; enhanced muscle regeneration; modestly extended lifespan | Zhang H, et al. *Science*. 2016;352(6292):1436-43. DOI: 10.1126/science.aaf2693 |
| Canto et al. 2012 | Mouse | NR enhanced oxidative metabolism, protected against high-fat diet metabolic abnormalities | Canto C, et al. *Cell Metab*. 2012;15(6):838-47 |
| Diguet et al. 2018 | Mouse | NR improved cardiac function in dilated cardiomyopathy model | Diguet N, et al. *Circulation*. 2018;137(21):2256-2269 |

#### Clinical Trial Status

| Study | Phase | Population | Status | Key Details |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| MCI trial (2024) | N/A | Older adults with MCI | Completed | Increased blood NAD+; well tolerated; did NOT alter cognition; modest NR-associated increase in DNA methylation; reduction in epigenetic age (PhenoAge and GrimAge). PMC10828186 |
| Long-COVID RCT (2025) | N/A | Long-COVID patients | Completed | 2000mg/day for 24 weeks, 58 participants. Published in *Lancet eClinicalMedicine* 2025 |
| Peripheral artery disease pilot (2025) | Pilot | PAD patients | Completed | 8 participants; improved cerebrovascular response and cognition |
| 2025 SCD/MCI study | N/A | Older adults with SCD/MCI | Completed | Safe but did NOT alter cognition |

**Key finding:** NR consistently and robustly raises blood NAD+ metabolites in humans, but has NOT consistently translated NAD+ increases into clinical endpoint improvements. The "NAD+ paradox" (blood NAD+ goes up, but clinical benefits are not reliably observed) raises fundamental questions about the NAD+ depletion theory of aging.

**Overall assessment (2025):** NMN and NR offer minimal benefits for muscle mass/function in adults over 60.

#### Safety Profile

- Very well-tolerated across all clinical trials at doses up to 2000 mg/day
- No serious adverse events
- Most common AEs: mild GI symptoms, flushing (less than niacin)
- No hepatotoxicity signal

### 3.3 CD38 Inhibitors

#### Mechanism of Action

CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein and ectoenzyme that is the primary NADase (NAD+-consuming enzyme) in mammalian tissues. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of NAD+ to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose.

**Key biology:**
- CD38 expression increases dramatically with age, driven by chronic inflammation (inflammaging)
- Senescent cells and inflammatory immune cells (M1 macrophages) express high CD38 levels
- CD38 is responsible for the majority of age-related NAD+ decline
- Inhibiting CD38 preserves NAD+ levels without requiring supplementation -- conceptually upstream of NMN/NR

**Therapeutic approach:** Maintain NAD+ by preventing degradation rather than supplying more precursors.

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Species | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Camacho-Pereira et al. 2016 | Mouse | CD38 drives age-related NAD+ decline; CD38 KO mice protected from metabolic dysfunction | Camacho-Pereira J, et al. *Cell Metab*. 2016;23(6):1127-39 |
| Tarago et al. 2018 | Mouse | 78c (CD38 inhibitor) reversed age-related NAD+ decline; improved exercise capacity and metabolic parameters | Tarago MG, et al. *Cell Metab*. 2018;27(5):1081-1095 |
| Chini et al. 2020 | Mouse | 78c restored NAD+ levels; improved cardiac and metabolic function | Chini CCS, et al. *Cell Metab*. 2020;32(3):384-399.e7 |

#### Clinical Trial Status

- **No dedicated CD38 inhibitor clinical trials for aging** as of early 2025
- Primarily at preclinical stage
- Anti-CD38 antibodies (daratumumab, isatuximab) approved for multiple myeloma but cause profound immune suppression -- not suitable for aging
- Small-molecule CD38 inhibitors (78c and analogs) in preclinical/early translational development
- Combination approaches (CD38 inhibitor + NMN/NR) being explored preclinically

## 4. METFORMIN

### 4.1 Metformin Overview

#### Mechanism of Action

Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide) has multiple proposed mechanisms of anti-aging action:

1. **AMPK activation (primary):** Inhibits mitochondrial complex I, leading to increased AMP:ATP ratio, which activates AMPK
   - Inhibits mTORC1 (via TSC2 phosphorylation)
   - Promotes autophagy
   - Enhances fatty acid oxidation
   - Improves glucose uptake
2. **mTORC1 inhibition (indirect):** Through AMPK, overlapping with rapamycin's mechanism
3. **Mitochondrial complex I inhibition:** Reduces ROS production at low concentrations
4. **Anti-inflammatory:** Reduces NF-kB, IL-6, TNF-alpha; may modulate cGAS-STING
5. **Gut microbiome modulation:** Increases *Akkermansia muciniphila* and other beneficial species
6. **Epigenetic effects:** May slow epigenetic aging (DNA methylation age acceleration)
7. **Insulin/IGF-1 signaling reduction:** By improving insulin sensitivity, reduces circulating insulin and IGF-1
8. **Anti-senescence effects (emerging):** May reduce senescent cell burden or SASP

#### TAME Trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin)

**Key Details:**
- **PI:** Nir Barzilai, MD (Albert Einstein College of Medicine)
- **Design:** Multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT
- **Population:** 3,000 adults aged 65-79, non-diabetic

- **Positive epidemiological data** (Bannister et al. 2014: diabetics on metformin lived 15% longer than non-diabetic controls) but RCT evidence remains mixed

#### Safety Profile

- Extremely well-characterized over 60+ years of clinical use (~150 million people worldwide)
- Common AEs: GI symptoms (20-30% -- improved with extended-release), metallic taste
- Vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term use
- Lactic acidosis: extremely rare (2-9 per 100,000 patient-years)
- **Key advantage over rapamycin:** No immunosuppression
- Cost: approximately $4/month (generic), making it uniquely accessible

## 5. EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING

Epigenetic reprogramming represents the most radical approach to aging reversal, based on the premise that aging is an epigenetic process that can be reversed by resetting the epigenome to a younger state without dedifferentiation.

---

### 5.1 Yamanaka Factors (OSKM/OSK)

#### Mechanism of Action

The Yamanaka factors -- Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) -- are transcription factors that can reprogram differentiated cells to a pluripotent state. In the longevity context, partial or transient expression of these factors (particularly OSK, omitting the oncogene c-Myc) can reverse epigenetic aging signatures without full dedifferentiation, essentially "resetting" cellular age while maintaining cell identity.

**Key principles:**
- Full reprogramming --> induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) -- not desirable in vivo
- Partial/transient reprogramming --> epigenetic rejuvenation while maintaining cell identity
- Duration and level of expression must be carefully controlled to avoid tumorigenesis

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Model | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| AAV-delivered OSK (2024) | 124-week-old mice | 109% extension of median remaining lifespan | PubMed: 38381405 |
| Cell 2025 (Belmonte) | Mouse | Prevalent mesenchymal drift reversed by partial reprogramming | *Cell*. 2025 |
| bioRxiv 2025 | In vitro/Mouse | Single-factor approach for safer cellular rejuvenation demonstrated | bioRxiv preprint, 2025 |

**Safety concern:** Cancer/tumorigenesis risk is the major obstacle. c-Myc is a known oncogene, and even OSK (without c-Myc) carries risk if expression is not precisely controlled.

**Chemical reprogramming alternatives** are under investigation as potentially safer approaches (Aging journal 2024 review).

#### Company Programs

## 6. GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS

GLP-1 receptor agonists, originally developed for type 2 diabetes and obesity, are emerging as potential geroprotective agents with inflammation-lowering and immunomodulatory effects that extend beyond metabolic control.

---

### 6.1 Semaglutide

#### Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist and incretin mimetic. Beyond its established metabolic effects (glucose-dependent insulin secretion, appetite suppression, weight loss), semaglutide has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties relevant to aging:

- Reduces systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha)
- Modulates immune cell function
- Reduces MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events) independent of weight loss
- Potential direct CNS effects via GLP-1 receptors in the brain

#### Preclinical and Clinical Evidence

**HIV and Epigenetic Aging (medRxiv 2025):**
- Semaglutide slowed DNA methylation aging in HIV-positive patients
- PCGrimAge: -3.1 years
- PhenoAge: -4.9 years
- DunedinPACE: 9% slower aging pace
- **Caveat:** HIV patients may not be generalizable to healthy populations

**Cardiovascular:** MACE reduction demonstrated to be independent of weight loss, suggesting direct vascular/anti-inflammatory geroprotective mechanisms.

**Alzheimer's Disease:**
- EVOKE and EVOKE+ Phase 3 trials underway for early Alzheimer's disease
- Testing whether GLP-1 agonism provides neuroprotection beyond metabolic effects

**Nature Biotechnology 2025:** Published a perspective piece asking "Are GLP-1s the first longevity drugs?" -- highlighting the breadth of potential geroprotective effects.

**Key limitation:** No healthy-population longevity trials have been conducted yet. Most evidence comes from metabolically unhealthy cohorts.

#### Safety Profile

- Well-established safety profile from diabetes/obesity use (millions of patients)
- Common AEs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (typically transient)
- Pancreatitis concern (rare, odds ratio modestly elevated)
- Thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents (not confirmed in humans)
- Muscle mass loss with weight loss is a concern for older adults

#### Key Publications

### 6.2 Tirzepatide

#### Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide / glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist. It activates both incretin receptor systems simultaneously, providing potentially broader metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects than GLP-1 agonism alone.

#### Clinical Evidence

- Emerging aging-relevant data, with similar class effects expected to semaglutide
- Cardiovascular and metabolic protection data accumulating from SURPASS and SURMOUNT trial programs
- No dedicated aging/longevity trials registered as of early 2025

#### Key Publications

- Ongoing data collection from cardiovascular outcomes trials

## 7. MITOCHONDRIAL THERAPIES

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging. Therapies targeting mitochondrial quality control (mitophagy), membrane integrity, and energy production represent a growing area of longevity research.

---

### 7.1 Urolithin A (Mitopure / Timeline / Amazentis)

#### Mechanism of Action

Urolithin A is a natural metabolite produced by gut bacteria from ellagitannins and ellagic acid (found in pomegranates, berries, walnuts). It is a potent mitophagy activator that promotes the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria, thereby improving overall mitochondrial quality and function.

**Mechanism:** Urolithin A activates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, triggering autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. This stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis to replace cleared organelles with functional new ones, improving cellular energy production and reducing oxidative stress.

#### Preclinical and Clinical Evidence

**Research scope:** 25+ registered human trials, $50M+ in R&D, 80+ global patents held by Timeline/Amazentis.

### 7.2 SS-31 / Elamipretide (FORZINITY)

#### Mechanism of Action

SS-31 (elamipretide) is a mitochondria-targeting tetrapeptide (D-Arg-dimethylTyr-Lys-Phe-NH2) that selectively concentrates in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its mechanism involves:

1. **Cardiolipin binding:** SS-31 binds cardiolipin, a phospholipid critical for cristae structure and electron transport chain organization
2. **Cristae stabilization:** Maintains mitochondrial membrane architecture
3. **ROS reduction:** Reduces reactive oxygen species generation at complex III
4. **ATP enhancement:** Improves electron transport chain efficiency and ATP production
5. **Cytochrome c optimization:** Stabilizes cytochrome c interaction with cardiolipin, preventing peroxidase activity

#### Preclinical Evidence

- Reverses age-related redox stress in preclinical models
- Improves exercise tolerance in aged mice
- Restores mitochondrial function in multiple tissue types

#### Clinical Trial Status

| Trial | Indication | Status |

### 8.1 Taurine

#### Mechanism of Action

Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a semi-essential amino acid abundant in bile, the large intestine, and multiple tissues. The 2023 landmark study by Singh et al. in *Science* identified taurine deficiency as a driver of aging across species, proposing it as a fundamental aging mechanism.

**Proposed anti-aging mechanisms:**
- Reduces cellular senescence

### 8.2 GlyNAC (Glycine + N-Acetylcysteine)

#### Mechanism of Action

GlyNAC is a combination of the amino acid glycine and the cysteine prodrug N-acetylcysteine. Together, they serve as precursors for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, the body's primary endogenous antioxidant:

```
Glycine + Cysteine (from NAC) + Glutamate --> [gamma-GCS, GS] --> Glutathione (GSH)
```

**Anti-aging mechanisms:**
- Restores age-depleted glutathione levels
- Improves mitochondrial function and fuel oxidation
- Reduces oxidative stress
- Lowers inflammation markers
- Improves genomic damage markers
- Enhances multiple hallmarks of aging simultaneously

Research is led by the Sekhar lab at Baylor College of Medicine.

#### Preclinical and Clinical Evidence

| Study | Design | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Sekhar 2024 (Innovation in Aging) | 36-week pilot RCT | GlyNAC for 24 weeks reversed multiple age-associated defects and improved cognition; stopping for 12 weeks --> defects returned | Innovation in Aging, 2024 |
| Sekhar 2024 | 16-week study | Safe, well-tolerated; reversed age-associated declines in glutathione, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and inflammation | 2024 publication |
| Kumar et al. 2023 | Older adults | Improved glutathione, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, inflammation, endothelial function, body composition, insulin resistance, cognition, strength, gait speed, exercise capacity | PMID: 35975308 |
| Kumar et al. 2021 | Pilot in older adults | 24-week supplementation corrected glutathione deficiency and improved multiple aging hallmarks | PMID: 33783984 |

**Alzheimer's implications:** GlyNAC supplementation has shown implications for brain health and Alzheimer's disease through glutathione restoration and oxidative stress reduction.

**Key observation:** Benefits reversed upon cessation of supplementation, suggesting ongoing use is necessary.

#### Safety Profile

- Safe and well-tolerated in all published studies
- Both glycine and NAC have extensive safety records as individual supplements
- NAC is FDA-approved (as Mucomyst for acetaminophen overdose)
- No significant adverse events reported

### 8.3 Spermidine

#### Mechanism of Action

Spermidine is a natural polyamine that is one of the most potent known autophagy inducers. Its primary mechanism involves:

1. **Autophagy induction via eIF5A hypusination:** Spermidine is the sole substrate for hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), which is essential for autophagy-related gene translation
2. **Acetyltransferase inhibition:** Spermidine inhibits EP300/CBP acetyltransferases, leading to deacetylation of autophagy-related proteins
3. **TFEB activation:** Promotes nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB
4. **Anti-inflammatory effects:** Reduces NF-kB and inflammatory cytokine production

#### Preclinical and Clinical Evidence

- **Cognitive effects are inconsistent:** Some studies show improvement in dementia patients; others show no effect (100 participants, 12 months, no benefit)
- **Safety data:** 40mg/day safe and well-tolerated in healthy older men over 28 days
- **POLYCAD trial:** 187 elderly patients with coronary artery disease, recruitment completed August 2025; cardiometabolic and muscle mass endpoints
- Spermidine is found in wheat germ, soybeans, aged cheese, and other foods

#### Safety Profile

- 40mg/day demonstrated safety and tolerability
- Natural dietary component
- No significant adverse events in published studies

- Muscle growth and maintenance
- Reduced fibrosis
- Improved metabolic function
- Enhanced physical performance

#### Preclinical Evidence

- **Intranasal AAV delivery** of follistatin extended mouse lifespan by approximately 30% and improved physical performance
- Demonstrated synergy when combined with Klotho gene therapy

#### Clinical Trial Status

- Combined with Klotho in a clinical trial for healthy adults (ongoing)
- Prior clinical experience with follistatin gene therapy in muscular dystrophy provides safety data

### 9.3 SIRT6 Overexpression

#### Mechanism of Action

SIRT6 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase (member of the sirtuin family) with critical roles in:

- **DNA repair:** Particularly double-strand break repair via NHEJ and HR pathways
- **Glucose homeostasis:** Regulates hepatic glucose output
- **Inflammation reduction:** Deacetylates NF-kB subunit RelA/p65, suppressing inflammatory gene transcription
- **Telomere maintenance:** Deacetylates histone H3K9 at telomeres, preventing telomere dysfunction
- **Chromatin regulation:** Maintains heterochromatin stability

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Model | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Cohen lab (Bar-Ilan University) | Transgenic mice | SIRT6 overexpression --> 30% lifespan increase in both sexes | Bar-Ilan University studies |

### 9.4 TERT Gene Therapy

#### Mechanism of Action

TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, the enzyme that elongates telomeres. Telomere shortening is a fundamental mechanism of cellular aging (the Hayflick limit). TERT gene therapy aims to:

- Extend telomeres, increasing cellular replicative capacity
- Improve tissue regeneration
- Reduce cellular senescence driven by telomere dysfunction

#### Preclinical Evidence

- **Blasco lab:** AAV-TERT extended mouse lifespan without increasing cancer incidence -- a critical safety finding given the theoretical concern that telomerase activation could promote tumorigenesis
- **TAC compound (2024):** A small molecule that epigenetically de-represses endogenous TERT expression, promoting new neuron formation -- combining telomere and transcription factor effects

#### Safety Profile

- AAV-TERT did not increase cancer incidence in mice (Blasco lab) -- addressing the primary safety concern
- TAC compound is in early-stage evaluation
- Standard AAV gene therapy risks apply

## 10. PLASMA AND YOUNG BLOOD APPROACHES

### 10.1 Heterochronic Parabiosis and Plasma Therapies

#### Overview

Heterochronic parabiosis (surgically joining the circulatory systems of young and old organisms) is an established rejuvenation model dating back to the 1950s. The field has evolved toward identifying specific factors in young blood that confer rejuvenation, as well as understanding whether the benefit comes from young factors or from dilution of aged factors.

#### Key Players and Approaches

| Entity | Approach | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Alkahest** (cofounded 2014 by Wyss-Coray) | Young fresh frozen plasma fractions for neurodegenerative disease | Clinical development |
| **Elevian** (Lee Rubin, Harvard) | GDF11 supplementation | Preclinical/early clinical |
| **Lyfspn** | Clinical trials of therapeutic plasmapheresis | Trial planning |

**GDF11 controversy:**
- Elevian is developing GDF11-based therapies
- GDF11 attenuates knee degeneration in mice
- However, controversy exists: some studies show GDF11 actually hinders muscle regeneration rather than promoting it
- The field remains divided on GDF11's net effect

**Conboy hypothesis (Irina Conboy, UC Berkeley):** The benefits of heterochronic parabiosis may come primarily from dilution and neutralization of pro-aging factors in old blood, rather than from positive rejuvenating factors in young blood. This has significant therapeutic implications -- plasmapheresis (blood filtering/dilution) could achieve similar results without requiring young plasma.

#### Safety Considerations

- Plasma transfusion carries standard risks (allergic reactions, infection transmission, TRALI)
- Plasmapheresis is an established medical procedure with known safety profile
- GDF11 supplementation safety in humans not yet established

#### Key Publications

## 11. INFLAMMAGING TARGETS

---

### 11.1 cGAS-STING Pathway

#### Mechanism of Action

The cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase -- Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway is an innate immune DNA sensing system that has emerged as a central driver of age-related inflammation (inflammaging):

1. **cGAS** detects cytosolic double-stranded DNA (from mitochondrial damage, nuclear envelope rupture, genomic instability)
2. cGAS synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger
3. cGAMP activates **STING** on the endoplasmic reticulum
4. STING activates TBK1 and IRF3, driving type I interferon production
5. STING also activates NF-kB, promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production
6. This creates a chronic inflammatory state that drives tissue dysfunction and age-related disease

**Why it matters for aging:** As cells age, they accumulate DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nuclear envelope defects that release DNA into the cytoplasm. The cGAS-STING pathway senses this damage and creates chronic sterile inflammation -- a self-reinforcing cycle of damage and inflammatory response.

#### Preclinical Evidence

| Study | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Nature 2023 | cGAS-STING drives ageing-related inflammation and neurodegeneration | *Nature*. 2023 |
| PNAS 2025 | Noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway drives cellular and organismal aging | *PNAS*. 2025 |
| H-151 studies | STING inhibitor H-151 improves strength and memory in aged mice | Preclinical studies |

**Therapeutic approaches:**
- **H-151:** Small-molecule STING inhibitor; improves strength and memory in aged mice
- **Novel indole STING inhibitors:** In development with improved pharmacological properties
- **STING degraders:** PROTACs/molecular glues targeting STING for degradation
- **Application across musculoskeletal diseases** is being explored

#### Clinical Trial Status

- Primarily preclinical as of early 2025
- Multiple pharmaceutical companies developing STING inhibitors for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, which could be repurposed for aging
- No dedicated aging trials registered

#### Key Publications

## 12. AUTOPHAGY MODULATORS

---

### 12.1 Novel Autophagy Enhancers

#### Overview

Autophagy (cellular self-eating) is a critical quality control mechanism that declines with age. Enhancing autophagy without the side effects of mTOR inhibition is a major therapeutic goal.

#### Key Compounds and Approaches

| Compound | Mechanism | Key Finding | Reference |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **AA-20** | Novel autophagy enhancer, TFEB-dependent | Extends C. elegans lifespan without mTORC1 inhibition | *PNAS*. 2025 |
| **Trehalose** | Disaccharide autophagy inducer | Known autophagy activator; TFEB activation | Multiple preclinical studies |
| **TFEB activators** | Pharmacological TFEB nuclear translocation | Targets age-related protein aggregation | Multiple preclinical studies |
| **SINE compounds (XPO1 inhibitors)** | Nuclear TFEB enrichment via export blockade | Prevents TFEB nuclear export, enhancing autophagic gene transcription | Preclinical studies |

**AA-20 (PNAS 2025):**
- Novel autophagy enhancer that operates through TFEB-dependent mechanisms
- Extends *C. elegans* lifespan without inhibiting mTORC1
- This is significant because it separates autophagy enhancement from mTOR inhibition, potentially avoiding the metabolic and immunosuppressive side effects of rapamycin

**TFEB as therapeutic target:** Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression. Multiple approaches to activate TFEB are being pursued:
- Direct pharmacological activators
- mTOR-independent TFEB activation (e.g., AA-20)
- XPO1/CRM1 inhibition to trap TFEB in the nucleus (SINE compounds like selinexor)

#### Clinical Trial Status

- AA-20: Preclinical (*C. elegans*)
- Trehalose: Available as supplement; no dedicated aging RCTs
- SINE compounds: Selinexor is FDA-approved for multiple myeloma; no aging indication trials

#### Key Publications

1. AA-20 autophagy enhancer. *PNAS*. 2025
2. TFEB as therapeutic target for aging-related proteostasis (review literature)

### Key Themes Across All Groups

1. **Translation gap persists:** Robust preclinical results have not consistently translated to clinical success (NR, RTB101, early UBX programs). The UBX1325 ASPIRE results and PEARL trial are encouraging exceptions.

2. **Safety-efficacy tradeoff:** The most potent interventions (navitoclax, Yamanaka factors, high-dose rapamycin) carry the most significant safety concerns. Local delivery (UBX1325) and intermittent dosing (D+Q, rapamycin) are strategies to improve the therapeutic window.

3. **Biomarker validation remains critical:** Epigenetic clocks (DunedinPACE, GrimAge, PhenoAge) are emerging as the preferred surrogate endpoints, as demonstrated by the semaglutide HIV study and NR MCI trial findings.

4. **Combination potential:** Multi-target approaches (rapamycin + acarbose, D+Q, GlyNAC, Klotho + follistatin) show promise but have limited clinical data.

5. **GLP-1 agonists as unexpected longevity candidates:** The emergence of semaglutide and tirzepatide as potential geroprotective agents was not predicted by traditional aging biology frameworks and highlights the importance of inflammation reduction.

6. **Gene therapy acceleration:** The field is moving rapidly from preclinical to clinical, with Altos Labs, Retro Biosciences, and others planning or initiating human trials in 2025-2026.

7. **Epigenetic reprogramming represents the ceiling:** OSK-mediated reprogramming (109% remaining lifespan extension) and Yamanaka factor approaches represent the theoretical maximum of aging reversal, but safety concerns (tumorigenesis) must be resolved before clinical application.

8. **Regulatory innovation:** The TAME trial's FDA framework, the FORZINITY approval, and the pivot to ARPA-H oversight are creating new pathways for aging interventions.

9. **Convergent mechanisms:** Many interventions converge on shared pathways -- autophagy (rapamycin, spermidine, urolithin A, AA-20), inflammation (metformin, semaglutide, cGAS-STING inhibitors), and NAD+ (NMN, NR, CD38 inhibitors, SIRT6) -- suggesting combination strategies targeting orthogonal mechanisms may be most effective.

10. **Accessibility spectrum:** Interventions range from widely accessible (metformin ~$4/month, taurine, GlyNAC) to highly specialized (gene therapy, epigenetic reprogramming), creating a tiered landscape of longevity options.
