## I. LANDMARK REVIEWS AND FRAMEWORKS

---

### [1] Lopez-Otin C, Blasco MA, Partridge L, Serrano M, Kroemer G. "Hallmarks of aging: An expanding universe." *Cell*, 2023;186(2):243-278.
- **Type:** Review (updated framework)
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.cell.2022.11.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.11.001)
- **PMID:** 36599349
- **Key Findings:** This landmark update expanded the hallmarks of aging from the original 9 (defined in 2013) to 12, adding three new hallmarks: disabled macroautophagy, chronic inflammation (inflammaging), and dysbiosis. The paper provides a comprehensive reassessment of each hallmark, their interconnections, and the growing evidence base for therapeutic targeting. Each hallmark satisfies three criteria: (1) age-associated manifestation, (2) experimental acceleration of aging when accentuated, and (3) the opportunity to decelerate, stop, or reverse aging through therapeutic intervention.
- **Impact:** This paper is the single most-cited reference framework for the aging research field, establishing the conceptual vocabulary and organizational schema used by essentially all researchers and drug developers in longevity science. It has garnered over 1,000 citations per year since publication.

### [15] Vellai T, Takacs-Vellai K, Deshpande SA. "Rapamycin for longevity: the pros, the cons, and future perspectives." *Frontiers in Aging*, 2025.
- **Type:** Review
- **DOI:** [10.3389/fragi.2025.1628187](https://doi.org/10.3389/fragi.2025.1628187)
- **PMID:** 40620657 | **PMCID:** PMC12226543
- **Key Findings:** Provides a balanced evaluation of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a longevity intervention. Summarizes extensive preclinical evidence (lifespan extension in mice up to 26%) while emphasizing that the long-term effects and safety of chronic mTOR inhibition in healthy humans remain unknown. Physicians and biohackers are using rapamycin off-label for age-related prevention despite it not being widely recognized as a treatment by the broader clinical community. Currently, rapamycin (sirolimus/everolimus) is FDA-approved only for transplant organ rejection prevention and anti-seizure therapy in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.
- **Impact:** An essential reference for clinicians and researchers weighing the risk-benefit profile of rapamycin in healthy aging populations. Highlights the critical gap between strong preclinical data and insufficient clinical evidence.

- **Type:** Review
- **DOI:** [10.3390/ijms261909372](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/19/9372)
- **Key Findings:** Classifies longevity pharmacological strategies into five broad categories: senolytics, senomorphics, NAD+ precursors, mTOR inhibitors, and metabolic modifiers (including metformin). Reviews the mechanisms, preclinical evidence, and translational potential of each class. Argues that the next phase of life extension will not rely on a single compound but on sophisticated, multi-modal regimens, shifting from the traditional "one-drug-one-target" approach.
- **Impact:** A comprehensive, up-to-date educational resource for anyone seeking to understand the full landscape of pharmacological anti-aging interventions as of 2025.

## II. CLINICAL TRIALS AND HUMAN STUDIES

---

### [4] Green CL, Lamming DW, et al. "Influence of rapamycin on safety and healthspan metrics after one year: PEARL trial results." *Aging*, 2025.
- **Type:** RCT (48-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled)
- **DOI:** See PMC link
- **PMID:** 40188830 | **PMCID:** PMC12074816
- **Key Findings:** The Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity (PEARL) trial enrolled 114 participants aged 50-85 who received placebo, 5 mg, or 10 mg compounded rapamycin weekly for 48 weeks. Low-dose, intermittent rapamycin was relatively safe in healthy, normative-aging adults, with adverse events similar across all groups. The study detected dose-dependent and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass and reduced pain in females (10 mg group), improved bone mineral content in men, and improved General Health self-reports (5 mg group). Visceral adiposity did not change significantly.
- **Impact:** The first long-duration RCT of rapamycin in healthy aging adults. Provides critical safety data and modest efficacy signals that will shape the design of larger Phase 2/3 trials. The sex-specific findings raise important questions about personalized dosing.

### [5] Pieramici DJ, et al. "Safety and Efficacy of Senolytic UBX1325 in Diabetic Macular Edema." *NEJM Evidence*, 2025.
- **Type:** RCT (Phase 2 BEHOLD + Phase 2b ASPIRE)
- **DOI:** [10.1056/EVIDoa2400009](https://doi.org/10.1056/EVIDoa2400009)
- **PMID:** 40261111
- **Key Findings:** UBX1325 (foselutoclax) is a senolytic Bcl-xL inhibitor administered as a single intravitreal injection. In the BEHOLD Phase 2 trial (65 participants with DME suboptimally responsive to anti-VEGF), the difference between UBX1325 and sham in mean change to week 48 in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was +5.6 ETDRS letters (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7). No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation. In the ASPIRE Phase 2b trial, UBX1325 was non-inferior to aflibercept at most time points through 36 weeks and outperformed aflibercept in patients with central subfield thickness below 400 microns.
- **Impact:** The most advanced clinical-stage senolytic therapy. Demonstrates that targeting senescent cells can yield durable visual improvements in a disease driven by cellular senescence. Validates the senolytic hypothesis in human ophthalmology.

### [6] Rinsch C, et al. "Effect of the mitophagy inducer urolithin A on age-related immune decline: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial." *Nature Aging*, 2025.
- **Type:** RCT (double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept)
- **PMID:** 41174221 | **PMCID:** PMC12618261
- **DOI:** [10.1038/s43587-025-00996-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00996-x)
- **Key Findings:** The MitoImmune study administered urolithin A (Mitopure) or placebo for 4 weeks in 50 healthy middle-aged adults. Urolithin A expanded peripheral naive-like, less terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 pp; P=0.0437) and increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 pp; P=0.0061). Reductions in inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) were also observed. NK cell numbers increased.
- **Impact:** First clinical evidence that a mitophagy activator can reverse immunosenescence markers in humans in just 28 days. Opens a new therapeutic axis for age-related immune decline.

### [7] Foulkes AS, et al. "Semaglutide Slows Epigenetic Aging in People with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial." *medRxiv*, 2025.
- **Type:** RCT (Phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled; preprint)
- **DOI:** [10.1101/2025.07.09.25331038](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.09.25331038)
- **PMID:** 40791720
- **Key Findings:** In a 32-week trial with 45 semaglutide and 39 placebo participants with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, semaglutide significantly decreased multiple epigenetic aging clocks: PCGrimAge (-3.1 years, P=0.007), GrimAge V1 (-1.4 years, P=0.02), GrimAge V2 (-2.3 years, P=0.009), PhenoAge (-4.9 years, P=0.004), and DunedinPACE (-0.09 units, approximately 9% slower pace, P=0.01). Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart.
- **Impact:** Provides the first clinical-trial evidence that a GLP-1 receptor agonist modulates validated epigenetic biomarkers of aging. This dramatically strengthens the case for GLP-1 agonists as potential geroprotective agents beyond their metabolic indications.

### [10] Xia M, et al. "A randomized placebo-controlled trial of nicotinamide riboside in older adults with mild cognitive impairment." *GeroScience*, 2024;46(1):665-682.
- **Type:** RCT (pilot, placebo-controlled)
- **PMID:** 37994989 | **PMCID:** PMC10828186
- **DOI:** [10.1007/s11357-023-00999-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-023-00999-9)
- **Key Findings:** Twenty subjects with MCI were randomized to placebo or NR with dose escalation to 1 g/day over 10 weeks. NR was safe and well-tolerated. Blood NAD+ levels increased significantly. The primary outcome (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) did not show statistically significant improvement. Predefined secondary outcomes including cerebral blood flow and additional neurocognitive tests were assessed. NR crossed the blood-brain barrier and modulated cerebral NAD+ metabolism.
- **Impact:** Important safety and feasibility data for NAD+ precursor supplementation in a cognitively impaired elderly population. The modest cognitive results temper expectations but the confirmed CNS bioavailability of NR supports further investigation with larger samples and longer durations.

### [12] Kumar P, Liu C, Suliburk J, et al. "Supplementing Glycine and N-Acetylcysteine (GlyNAC) in Older Adults Improves Glutathione Deficiency, Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Inflammation, Physical Function, and Aging Hallmarks: A Randomized Clinical Trial." *Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences*, 2023;78(1):75-89.
- **Type:** RCT (16-week, placebo-controlled)
- **PMID:** 35975308 | **PMCID:** PMC9879756
- **DOI:** [10.1093/gerona/glac135](https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glac135)
- **Key Findings:** Twenty-four older adults and 12 young adults were studied. Older adults randomized to GlyNAC (N=12) or alanine placebo (N=12) for 16 weeks. Compared to young adults, older adults had glutathione deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, multiple aging hallmarks, and impaired physical function. GlyNAC supplementation corrected all of these defects; placebo did not. GlyNAC was safe and well-tolerated.
- **Impact:** One of the most impressive multi-endpoint improvements seen in any aging supplement trial. GlyNAC simultaneously addresses multiple hallmarks of aging through a simple, inexpensive, and well-tolerated nutritional intervention. A larger confirmatory trial is warranted.

### [16] Fielding RA, et al. "A pilot study of senolytics to improve cognition and mobility in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease." *eBioMedicine (The Lancet)*, 2025.
- **Type:** Pilot study (single-arm, open-label, pre-post; STAMINA trial)
- **PMID:** 40010154 | **PMCID:** PMC11907475
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105568](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105568)
- **Key Findings:** Twelve older adults aged 65+ with slow gait speed and MCI received dasatinib 100 mg + quercetin 1250 mg for two days every two weeks over 12 weeks. No serious adverse events. Mean MoCA scores non-significantly increased by 1.0 point overall, but increased significantly by 2.0 points (95% CI: 0.1-4.0) in those with lowest baseline scores. Reductions in TNF-alpha correlated with cognitive improvements.
- **Impact:** First senolytic trial targeting Alzheimer's disease precursors. The correlation between inflammatory marker reduction and cognitive improvement provides mechanistic plausibility and supports the design of larger controlled trials of senolytics in dementia prevention.

### [17] Justice JN, Nambiar AM, Tchkonia T, et al. "Senolytics dasatinib and quercetin in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: results of a phase I, single-blind, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial on feasibility and tolerability." *eBioMedicine (The Lancet)*, 2023;90:104481.
- **Type:** RCT (Phase I, single-blind, placebo-controlled)
- **PMID:** 36857968 | **PMCID:** PMC10006434
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104481](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104481)
- **Key Findings:** Twelve participants with IPF were randomized 1:1 to D+Q (dasatinib 100 mg/day + quercetin 1250 mg/day, three consecutive days per week) or matching placebo for three weeks. The D+Q regimen was feasible and well-tolerated. IPF is associated with increased senescent cell burden, making it a model disease for senolytic testing. Important areas for safety and symptom monitoring in next-stage trials were identified.
- **Impact:** Extends the senolytic clinical evidence base to fibrotic lung disease. IPF remains a disease with poor prognosis and limited treatment options, making senolytic targeting of the underlying senescence pathology a compelling therapeutic strategy.

### [18] Kim M, et al. "Ingestion of beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide increased blood NAD levels, maintained walking speed, and improved sleep quality in older adults in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study." *GeroScience*, 2024.
- **Type:** RCT (double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group)
- **PMID:** 38789831
- **Key Findings:** Sixty older adult participants consumed 250 mg/day NMN or placebo for 12 weeks. The NMN group had significantly shorter 4-meter walking time, significantly higher blood NAD+ and metabolite levels, and improved sleep quality (lower "Daytime dysfunction" and "Global" Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire scores) compared to placebo. No adverse effects were observed.
- **Impact:** Adds to the growing body of evidence that NMN supplementation can produce measurable functional improvements in older adults, particularly in locomotor function and sleep quality---two domains of major concern in aging populations.

### [19] Li H, et al. "Efficacy of oral nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism for adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials." *Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition*, 2024.
- **Type:** Meta-analysis (12 RCTs, 513 participants)
- **PMID:** 39116016
- **DOI:** [10.1080/10408398.2024.2387324](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2024.2387324)
- **Key Findings:** Meta-analysis found a significant overall effect of NMN supplementation on elevating blood NAD+ levels. However, most clinically relevant glucose and lipid metabolism outcomes were not significantly different between NMN and control groups. Risk-of-bias assessment showed some concerns in seven studies and high risk in five. The authors concluded that an exaggeration of the benefits of NMN supplementation may exist in the field.
- **Impact:** A critical counterbalance to the enthusiastic NMN supplement market. Highlights that while NMN reliably raises NAD+, the downstream clinical benefits remain uncertain and may be overstated by industry-sponsored research.

### [20] Mannick JB, Del Giudice G, Lattanzi M, et al. "mTOR inhibition improves immune function in the elderly." *Science Translational Medicine*, 2014;6(268):268ra179.
- **Type:** RCT (Phase 2a)
- **DOI:** [10.1126/scitranslmed.3009892](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3009892)
- **PMID:** 25540326
- **Key Findings:** Low-dose everolimus (RAD001) enhanced influenza vaccine response by approximately 20% in 218 elderly volunteers. Additionally, RAD001 reduced the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressing the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, which inhibits T cell signaling and is more highly expressed with age. The treatment was relatively well tolerated.
- **Impact:** A paradigm-shifting study demonstrating that mTOR inhibition can enhance (rather than suppress) immune function in older adults at low doses. This provided the first human evidence for mTOR modulation as a geroprotective strategy and opened the clinical path for rapamycin/rapalog research in aging.

### [43] Singh A, et al. "Urolithin A improves muscle strength, exercise performance, and biomarkers of mitochondrial health in a randomized trial in middle-aged adults." *Cell Reports Medicine*, 2022;3(5):100633.
- **Type:** RCT (randomized, placebo-controlled)
- **PMID:** 35584623 | **PMCID:** PMC9133463
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.xcrm.2022.100633](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2022.100633)
- **Key Findings:** Four months of urolithin A supplementation at 500 mg or 1000 mg significantly improved hamstring leg muscle strength by approximately 12% (P=0.027 and P=0.029 vs. placebo for 500 mg and 1000 mg, respectively). Clinically meaningful improvements were observed in aerobic endurance (peak VO2) and physical performance (6-minute walk test). Plasma acylcarnitines and C-reactive protein were significantly lower, indicating higher mitochondrial efficiency and reduced inflammation.
- **Impact:** Provides robust clinical evidence for urolithin A as a mitophagy-activating supplement with meaningful functional outcomes in muscle strength---a critical aging domain. Supports the mitochondrial dysfunction hallmark as a druggable target.

## III. PRECLINICAL STUDIES

---

### [2] Singh P, Gollapalli K, Manber S, et al. "Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging." *Science*, 2023;380(6649):eabn9257.
- **Type:** Preclinical (multi-species) + human observational
- **DOI:** [10.1126/science.abn9257](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9257)
- **PMID:** 37289866
- **Key Findings:** Taurine concentrations decline with age in mice, monkeys, and humans. Taurine supplementation in mice increased median lifespan by 10-12% and improved healthspan across multiple organ systems. In monkeys, taurine improved bone density, metabolic markers, and immune function. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine levels correlated with higher BMI and adverse metabolic profiles; taurine levels increased after acute endurance exercise.
- **Impact:** A multi-species study from Columbia University that identified taurine deficiency as a potential causal driver of aging. Generated enormous public interest and prompted consideration of taurine as an inexpensive geroprotective supplement, though human longevity trials have not yet been conducted.

### [3] Macip CC, Czyz S, Castiglione GM, et al. "Gene Therapy-Mediated Partial Reprogramming Extends Lifespan and Reverses Age-Related Changes in Aged Mice." *Cellular Reprogramming*, 2024;26(1):24-32.
- **Type:** Preclinical (animal, in vivo gene therapy)
- **DOI:** [10.1089/cell.2023.0072](https://doi.org/10.1089/cell.2023.0072)
- **PMID:** 38381405 | **PMCID:** PMC10909732
- **Key Findings:** A systemically delivered two-part AAV system with doxycycline-inducible OSK (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4---Yamanaka factors without c-Myc) was cycled in 2-year-old wild-type mice. This treatment produced a remarkable 109% increase in median remaining lifespan with improved health condition relative to doxycycline-treated controls. Treatments led to profound age reversal in heart and liver tissues, as well as human keratinocytes, as assessed by DNA methylation clocks.
- **Impact:** Among the most dramatic lifespan extension results ever reported from a partial reprogramming intervention in wild-type mice. The use of AAV9 delivery provides a translatable therapeutic modality, though safety concerns around long-term Yamanaka factor expression remain.

### [8] Gulen MF, Samson N, Keller A, et al. "cGAS-STING drives ageing-related inflammation and neurodegeneration." *Nature*, 2023;620:374-380.
- **Type:** Preclinical (mechanistic + animal)
- **DOI:** [10.1038/s41586-023-06373-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06373-1)
- **PMID:** 37532932
- **Key Findings:** The cGAS-STING signaling pathway was identified as a critical driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during aging. Blockade of STING suppressed inflammatory phenotypes of senescent human cells and tissues, attenuated ageing-related inflammation in multiple peripheral organs and the brain, and improved tissue function in mice. STING activation triggered reactive microglial transcriptional states, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Cytosolic DNA released from perturbed mitochondria elicited cGAS activity in old microglia.
- **Impact:** Identifies a specific druggable pathway (cGAS-STING) through which mitochondrial dysfunction drives inflammaging and neurodegeneration. Inhibiting STING in aged mice improved both memory and physical function, making this pathway a major therapeutic target for age-related neurological decline.

### [9] Faria RC, Silva JF, et al. "A noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway drives cellular and organismal aging." *PNAS*, 2025;122(28):e2424666122.
- **Type:** Preclinical (mechanistic + animal)
- **DOI:** [10.1073/pnas.2424666122](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2424666122)
- **PMID:** 40638086 | **PMCID:** PMC12280946
- **Key Findings:** Reveals that aging cells activate inflammatory programs via a noncanonical pathway driven by cGAS and STING that differs from the canonical pathway of activation. In aging human fibroblasts, senescent fibroblasts, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome fibroblasts, STING does not follow the canonical activation mechanism. Pharmacological inhibition of the noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway ameliorated cellular, tissue, and organismal decline in progeria models.
- **Impact:** Extends the cGAS-STING aging story by revealing that the pathway operates through a distinct noncanonical mechanism in aging, which has important implications for drug design---inhibitors targeting canonical STING activation may be insufficient for age-related conditions.

### [11] Roig-Soriano J, Edo A, Verdes S, et al. "Long-term effects of s-KL treatment in wild-type mice: Enhancing longevity, physical well-being, and neurological resilience." *Molecular Therapy*, 2025;33(4):1449-1465.
- **Type:** Preclinical (gene therapy, animal)
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.ymthe.2025.02.030](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2025.02.030)
- **PMID:** 39988871
- **Key Findings:** A single administration of AAV9 coding for secreted Klotho protein (s-KL) to adult wild-type mice resulted in a 19.7% increase in lifespan. Beyond lifespan extension, the gene therapy improved bone health, muscle regeneration capacity, and brain aging markers. Neuroinflammation was reduced and neurotrophic factors increased. This is the first AAV-mediated s-KL study to demonstrate lifespan extension in wild-type (non-transgenic) mice.
- **Impact:** Klotho has long been recognized as a longevity-associated protein, but this study provides the first translatable gene therapy proof-of-concept. A single dose producing a nearly 20% lifespan increase is highly encouraging for clinical development.

### [14] Tammineni P, et al. "Autophagy activator AA-20 improves proteostasis and extends Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan." *PNAS*, 2025;122(32):e2423455122.
- **Type:** Preclinical (in vitro + C. elegans)
- **DOI:** [10.1073/pnas.2423455122](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2423455122)
- **PMID:** 40758884
- **Key Findings:** AA-20 is a novel small-molecule autophagy activator that enhances autophagy and lipid droplet clearance in human cells and C. elegans. AA-20 reduces polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner, promotes fitness, and extends lifespan in wild-type nematodes but not in autophagy-deficient mutants. Critically, AA-20 acts through transcription factor EB (TFEB) without inhibiting mTORC1, distinguishing it from rapamycin.
- **Impact:** Addresses a key unmet need---an autophagy activator that bypasses mTOR inhibition and its associated immunosuppressive side effects. Supports disabled macroautophagy (one of the new hallmarks) as a druggable target through a novel mechanism.

### [21] Barrero MJ, et al. "Prevalent mesenchymal drift in aging and disease is reversed by partial reprogramming." *Cell*, 2025.
- **Type:** Preclinical (computational + in vitro + in vivo)
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.cell.2025.00853](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00853-0)
- **PMID:** 40816266
- **Key Findings:** Analysis of gene expression data from over 40 human tissues and 20 diseases revealed a pervasive "mesenchymal drift" (MD)---upregulation of mesenchymal genes and altered stromal cell composition during aging. Increased MD correlates with disease progression, reduced patient survival, and elevated mortality risk. Yamanaka factor-induced partial reprogramming markedly reduced MD before dedifferentiation, through a partial mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Transient 1-week OSKM expression suppressed MD without activating pluripotency markers like NANOG.
- **Impact:** Provides a unifying molecular explanation for age-related tissue deterioration across dozens of tissues and diseases, and demonstrates that partial reprogramming can specifically target this mechanism. Establishes mesenchymal drift as a fundamental aging phenotype.

### [22] Gorbunova V, Seluanov A, et al. "TERT activation targets DNA methylation and multiple aging hallmarks." *Cell*, 2024;187(16):4295-4313.e25.
- **Type:** Preclinical (high-throughput screen + animal)
- **DOI:** [10.1016/j.cell.2024.05920](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.05920)
- **PMID:** 38908367
- **Key Findings:** A high-throughput screen of over 650,000 compounds identified a TERT activating compound (TAC) that epigenetically de-represses the TERT gene via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade. In naturally aged mice, TAC elevated TERT levels, promoted telomere synthesis, reduced cellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silenced p16INK4a via DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC alleviated neuroinflammation, increased neurotrophic factors, stimulated adult neurogenesis, and preserved cognitive function without cancer risk.
- **Impact:** Demonstrates that TERT has functions beyond telomere maintenance---acting as a transcriptional co-regulator of aging-related genes. The identification of a druggable small molecule that restores TERT expression without gene therapy is a major advance for the telomere biology of aging field.

### [25] Roichman A, Elhanati S, Aon MA, et al. "Restoration of energy homeostasis by SIRT6 extends healthy lifespan." *Nature Communications*, 2021;12:3208.
- **Type:** Preclinical (transgenic mice)
- **DOI:** [10.1038/s41467-021-23545-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23545-7)
- **PMID:** 34050173
- **Key Findings:** Haim Cohen's lab at Bar-Ilan University showed that SIRT6 overexpression extended lifespan in both male and female mice by approximately 30%. SIRT6-transgenic mice exhibited preserved hepatic glucose output, enhanced gluconeogenesis from lactate and glycerol, reduced frailty, and maintained vigorous physical activity equivalent to young mice into old age. Mechanistically, SIRT6 restored energy homeostasis by promoting de novo NAD+ synthesis.
- **Impact:** Establishes SIRT6 as one of the most potent single-gene longevity targets discovered. The 30% lifespan extension in both sexes is among the largest reported for any single genetic intervention in mice. Provides a strong rationale for developing SIRT6 activators.

- **PMID:** 38267706
- **Key Findings:** CAR T cells targeting uPAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) on senescent cells were administered to aged mice. Treatment improved exercise capacity in physiological aging and ameliorated metabolic dysfunction (improved glucose tolerance). A single low dose provided prophylactic protection against age-related and diet-induced metabolic decline lasting over one year---far exceeding the duration of small-molecule senolytics.
- **Impact:** A paradigm shift from small-molecule senolytics to immunotherapy-based senolytic approaches. The long-lasting prophylactic effect of a single dose distinguishes CAR T senolytics from D+Q or fisetin, which require repeated administration.

- **PMID:** 39806003
- **Key Findings:** Analysis of multimodal data from 9,331 individuals revealed that CpG mutations coincide with methylation changes, not only at the mutated site but with pervasive methylome remodeling extending 10 kilobases in each direction. Somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals (Pearson r=0.67 for mutation clock vs. r=0.83 for methylation clock in predicting chronological age).
- **Impact:** Bridges two major theories of aging---mutational and epigenetic---by demonstrating that somatic mutations drive cascading epigenetic changes. This raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks are measuring epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations. Has profound implications for whether epigenetic rejuvenation therapies address root causes or symptoms.

- **PMID:** 39384074
- **Key Findings:** Evaluates fisetin as a senotherapeutic based on in vitro, in vivo, and early clinical evidence. Fisetin can selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells in vitro, but its impact varies by cell type and type of senescence---it is not a universal senolytic. In humans, a reduction in senescent cells was observed with 100 mg/day fisetin. Targeting senescent cells with fisetin offers a promising strategy for managing multiple chronic diseases, but further studies are needed to establish safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy.
- **Impact:** Provides a balanced, evidence-based assessment of fisetin's senolytic potential at a time when it is widely marketed as an anti-aging supplement with limited clinical validation.

- **Key Findings:** Shift Bioscience identified a novel single-gene target called SB000 that achieves cellular rejuvenation at both the methylome and transcriptome levels across multiple cell types without activating pluripotency pathways. SB000 demonstrated comparable methylome rejuvenation to the Yamanaka factors (OSKM) while being fundamentally safer---it does not induce the dangerous pluripotency pathway that hinders OSKM therapeutic viability.
- **Impact:** If validated in vivo, a single-gene rejuvenation target would be transformatively simpler and safer to deliver therapeutically compared to multi-factor cocktails. The absence of pluripotency induction is a critical safety advantage. However, the gene identity has been kept proprietary, and the preprint has generated some scientific skepticism pending independent replication.
