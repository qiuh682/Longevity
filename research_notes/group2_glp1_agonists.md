## 2.1 Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus)

### Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) developed by Novo Nordisk. It mimics the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), binding to GLP-1 receptors expressed across multiple organ systems.

**Core pharmacology:**
- **Modified GLP-1 analog:** 94% homology to native human GLP-1, with key modifications:
  - Amino acid substitution at position 8 (Aib) preventing DPP-4 degradation
  - Fatty acid (C18 diacid) attachment via linker enabling albumin binding
  - Result: Half-life of ~7 days (vs. ~2 minutes for native GLP-1), enabling weekly dosing
- **Subcutaneous (Ozempic, Wegovy) and oral (Rybelsus) formulations**

**GLP-1 receptor signaling and multi-organ effects:**

1. **Pancreas:** Glucose-dependent insulin secretion (incretin effect), glucagon suppression, beta-cell preservation, enhanced beta-cell proliferation
2. **Brain/hypothalamus:** Appetite suppression, satiety signaling, reduced food reward, nausea (side effect), neuroprotective effects
3. **Cardiovascular system:** Reduced inflammation, improved endothelial function, reduced atherosclerosis progression, direct cardioprotective effects
4. **Liver:** Reduced hepatic steatosis, improved liver inflammation (NASH/MAFLD), reduced de novo lipogenesis
5. **Kidney:** Reduced albuminuria, preserved GFR, anti-inflammatory effects in glomeruli
6. **Adipose tissue:** Reduced visceral adiposity, improved adipokine profile, reduced adipose tissue inflammation
7. **Immune system:** Anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of macrophage polarization (M1 to M2 shift), reduced NF-kB activation

### Proposed Geroprotective Mechanisms

The emerging interest in semaglutide as a longevity compound is based on multiple overlapping mechanisms that target hallmarks of aging:

1. **Chronic inflammation reduction (inflammaging):**
   - CRP reduction: 30-40% in clinical trials
   - IL-6 reduction: 15-25%
   - TNF-alpha reduction: reported in multiple studies
   - This directly targets the inflammaging hallmark

2. **Metabolic improvement:**
   - Dramatic weight loss (15-20% body weight)
   - Reduced visceral adiposity (the most metabolically harmful fat depot)
   - Improved insulin sensitivity
   - Reduced hyperinsulinemia
   - Lower circulating IGF-1 (via reduced insulin/improved metabolic health)
   - These effects overlap with caloric restriction, the most robustly proven lifespan-extending intervention

3. **Cardiovascular protection:**
   - SELECT trial: 20% reduction in MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events) in non-diabetic obese patients
   - Reduced atherosclerosis progression
   - Anti-inflammatory effects on vasculature
   - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death; reducing it directly extends lifespan

4. **Potential neuroprotection:**
   - GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the brain
   - Preclinical data shows reduced neuroinflammation, improved synaptic function, enhanced neurogenesis
   - Clinical trials in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease underway

5. **Cellular senescence modulation (emerging):**
   - Some preclinical evidence suggests GLP-1 RAs may reduce senescent cell burden in adipose tissue and vasculature [VERIFY]
   - Mechanism may be indirect (via reduced inflammation and metabolic improvement)

6. **Autophagy enhancement (emerging):**
   - GLP-1R signaling may activate AMPK and enhance autophagy in certain tissues
   - Weight loss itself enhances autophagic flux

### Key Clinical Trial Data Relevant to Aging/Longevity

| Trial | Population | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) | T2DM, high CV risk | Semaglutide 0.5mg/1.0mg weekly reduced MACE by 26% vs. placebo (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95) | Marso SP, et al. NEJM. 2016;375(19):1834-44. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1607141 |
| SELECT (NCT03574597) | Non-diabetic obesity, high CV risk | Semaglutide 2.4mg weekly reduced MACE by 20% vs. placebo (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.90, p<0.001); first demonstration of CV benefit in non-diabetic obese patients | Lincoff AM, et al. NEJM. 2023;389(24):2221-2232. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2307563 |
| STEP 1-5 (various NCTs) | Obesity | 15-17% body weight loss with semaglutide 2.4mg weekly; sustained over 68 weeks | Wilding JPH, et al. NEJM. 2021;384(11):989-1002 |
| FLOW (NCT03819153) | T2DM + CKD | Semaglutide reduced risk of kidney disease progression by 24% (HR 0.76); trial stopped early for efficacy (2024) | Perkovic V, et al. NEJM. 2024 [VERIFY exact citation] |
| STEP-HFpEF (NCT04788511) | Obesity + HFpEF | Semaglutide improved heart failure symptoms, exercise capacity, reduced body weight and inflammation in HFpEF | Kosiborod MN, et al. NEJM. 2023;389(12):1069-1084 |

### 2023-2025 Longevity-Specific Developments

- **SELECT trial (2023):** The most significant development for longevity. By demonstrating 20% MACE reduction in non-diabetic obese patients, SELECT showed that semaglutide reduces the leading cause of death in a broad population. This is functionally a longevity finding, even though the trial was not designed as a longevity study.

- **FLOW trial (2024):** Kidney protection in diabetics suggests semaglutide protects against another major age-related organ decline.

- **Alzheimer's and Parkinson's trials:**
  - NCT04777396: Phase 3 EVOKE/EVOKE+ trials testing oral semaglutide in early Alzheimer's disease (3,700+ participants); expected completion ~2025-2026 [VERIFY]
  - Preclinical studies show GLP-1 RAs reduce amyloid-beta accumulation, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation
  - If positive, would add neurodegeneration to the list of age-related diseases semaglutide can address

- **Epigenetic age analysis:** Researchers have begun analyzing whether semaglutide slows epigenetic aging using GrimAge/DunedinPACE in clinical trial samples [VERIFY for publications]

- **All-cause mortality signal:** Post-hoc analyses of combined clinical trial data suggest semaglutide may reduce all-cause mortality, though no single trial was powered for this endpoint. The signal is largely driven by CV death reduction.

- **"Ozempic effect" on multiple diseases:** Large real-world database analyses (electronic health records, insurance claims) have reported associations between GLP-1 RA use and reduced incidence of multiple age-related conditions:
  - Reduced cancer incidence (especially obesity-related cancers)
  - Reduced dementia/cognitive decline
  - Reduced liver disease progression
  - Reduced kidney disease
  - Reduced osteoarthritis symptoms
  - These are observational and subject to confounding, but the breadth of associations is striking [VERIFY for specific publications]

### Safety/Adverse Event Profile

**Well-characterized from extensive clinical trial program (40,000+ participants across trials):**

**Common AEs (dose-dependent):**
- GI effects: Nausea (20-44%), diarrhea (10-30%), vomiting (5-24%), constipation (10-24%) -- typically mild-moderate, improve over time, worst during dose escalation
- Injection site reactions (subcutaneous formulations)
- Headache, fatigue

**Significant safety signals:**
- **Pancreatitis:** Small increased risk (~0.1-0.3% vs. placebo); monitor for symptoms
- **Gallbladder events:** Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis increased with rapid weight loss (3-5x risk)
- **Diabetic retinopathy worsening:** In diabetics with existing retinopathy, rapid glucose improvement can transiently worsen retinopathy (SUSTAIN 6 signal)
- **Thyroid C-cell tumors:** Black box warning based on rodent studies (dose-dependent medullary thyroid carcinoma in rats). NOT observed in humans to date, but long-term surveillance ongoing. GLP-1 receptors are present on rodent but not (or minimally) human thyroid C-cells, suggesting this is a species-specific effect.
- **Lean mass loss:** ~40% of weight lost is lean mass (muscle), raising concerns for sarcopenia in elderly; resistance training recommended as adjunct
- **Rebound weight gain:** Weight regain upon discontinuation is near-universal; long-term/lifelong use may be required
- **Suicidality signal:** Under EMA investigation (2023-2024); preliminary data does not confirm causal link [VERIFY for regulatory conclusion]
- **Ileus/bowel obstruction:** Rare but serious reports of delayed gastric emptying causing surgical complications

**Key safety advantage:** Unlike rapamycin, semaglutide does NOT cause immunosuppression. Unlike metformin, GI side effects improve over time for most patients.

### Controversies

- **Not tested as a longevity drug:** All data is secondary analysis of metabolic/CV trials. No trial has been designed with aging endpoints.
- **Weight loss vs. geroprotection:** Is semaglutide geroprotective per se, or are its benefits entirely mediated by weight loss (which independently improves nearly all aging biomarkers)?
- **Lean mass loss concern:** Loss of muscle mass is counter to healthy aging goals; may accelerate sarcopenia in elderly
- **Cost barrier:** ~$1,000-1,300/month (US) limits access; not yet approved/covered for longevity indication
- **Lifelong dependency:** Weight regain upon stopping suggests chronic use is needed, raising long-term safety questions
- **Observational data confounding:** Real-world database associations may reflect healthy user bias, indication bias, or reverse causation

## 2.2 Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)

### Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide (Eli Lilly) is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist -- the first approved "twincretin."

**Dual incretin mechanism:**
- **GLP-1 receptor agonism:** Same downstream effects as semaglutide (see above)
- **GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptor agonism:** Additional metabolic effects:
  - Enhanced insulin secretion (additive to GLP-1)
  - Improved adipocyte function
  - Enhanced lipid metabolism
  - Possible direct effects on bone metabolism (GIP receptors on osteoblasts)
  - Possible neuroprotective effects (GIP receptors in brain)

**Key pharmacological difference from semaglutide:**
- Dual receptor activation produces greater metabolic effects
- Greater weight loss (~22.5% at highest dose vs. ~15-17% for semaglutide)
- Potentially different tissue-specific effects due to GIP receptor activation
- Weekly subcutaneous dosing (similar to semaglutide)

### Anti-Aging Data

**Clinical data relevant to aging:**

| Trial | Key Finding | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| SURMOUNT-1 | 22.5% mean body weight loss at 72 weeks (15mg dose); obesity without diabetes | Jastreboff AM, et al. NEJM. 2022;387(4):327-340. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2206038 |
| SURPASS-4 | CV composite endpoint: HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.51-1.08); trend toward MACE reduction but not statistically significant (not powered) | Del Prato S, et al. Lancet. 2021;398(10313):1811-1824 |
| SURMOUNT-MMO (NCT05556512) | Phase 3 dedicated MACE outcomes trial in obese non-diabetic; 15,000 participants; ongoing; expected 2027 [VERIFY] | -- |
| SURPASS-CVOT (NCT04255433) | Phase 3 CV outcomes in T2DM; ongoing [VERIFY] | -- |
| SUMMIT (HFpEF) | Tirzepatide improved HFpEF symptoms; presented at AHA 2024 [VERIFY] | -- |

**Potential geroprotective advantages over semaglutide:**
- Greater weight loss may translate to greater metabolic benefit
- GIP receptor activation in bone could mitigate bone density loss seen with rapid weight loss
- Dual agonism may produce broader anti-inflammatory effects
- However, dedicated MACE outcomes data is still pending (SURMOUNT-MMO)

### Safety Profile

Similar to semaglutide with some differences:
- **GI side effects:** Nausea (12-33%), diarrhea (12-22%), vomiting (2-10%) -- possibly less severe than semaglutide at equipotent doses [VERIFY]
- **Same class warnings:** Pancreatitis, thyroid C-cell tumors (rodents), gallbladder events
- **Injection site reactions**
- **Lean mass loss:** Same concern as semaglutide; possibly more pronounced with greater total weight loss

## 2.3 GLP-1 Agonists as Geroprotective Agents: Mechanistic Analysis

### Overlap with Established Aging Pathways

GLP-1 RAs intersect with multiple established geroprotective pathways:

| Aging Pathway | GLP-1 RA Effect | Overlap with Other Geroprotectors |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| mTOR signaling | Indirect reduction (via improved insulin/metabolic status) | Rapamycin (direct), Metformin (indirect) |
| AMPK activation | Modest activation via metabolic improvement | Metformin (primary mechanism) |
| Inflammation/NF-kB | Direct suppression of inflammatory pathways | Rapamycin, Metformin |
| Insulin/IGF-1 signaling | Reduced hyperinsulinemia, improved sensitivity | Metformin, Caloric restriction |
| Cellular senescence | Possible indirect reduction (via inflammation reduction) | Senolytics (direct) |
| Autophagy | Possible enhancement (via AMPK, metabolic improvement) | Rapamycin (direct), Spermidine |
| Nutrient sensing | Improved glucose/lipid sensing | Metformin, Rapamycin |
| Visceral adiposity | Dramatic reduction | Caloric restriction |

### Caloric Restriction Mimetic?

The most compelling geroprotective argument for GLP-1 RAs is that they may function as pharmacological caloric restriction mimetics:

- They produce sustained caloric reduction (15-30% reduction in caloric intake)
- They dramatically reduce visceral adiposity
- They improve the metabolic profile in ways that mirror CR (reduced insulin, reduced IGF-1, reduced inflammation)
- CR is the most robustly proven lifespan-extending intervention across species

**However, key differences from CR:**
- The weight loss includes significant lean mass loss (CR in rodents typically preserves lean mass better)
- GLP-1 RAs have direct pharmacological effects beyond appetite suppression
- The nausea/food aversion mechanism differs from voluntary dietary restriction

### Ongoing and Planned Longevity-Relevant Studies

- Multiple observational studies analyzing EHR data for GLP-1 RA associations with age-related diseases [VERIFY]
- No dedicated longevity/aging clinical trial for any GLP-1 RA as of early 2025
- Discussion in the longevity field about whether a "TAME-like" trial should be conducted with semaglutide
- The breadth of clinical benefits (CV, renal, hepatic, potentially neurological) makes GLP-1 RAs arguably the most exciting geroprotective candidates of the 2023-2025 period

### Controversy: Is This Just Weight Loss?

The central debate is whether GLP-1 RAs have geroprotective effects independent of weight loss:

**Arguments for weight-independent effects:**
- GLP-1 receptors are expressed in tissues where weight loss would have minimal direct impact (brain, heart, kidney)
- Anti-inflammatory effects are disproportionate to weight loss magnitude
- Cardioprotection in SELECT emerged before maximum weight loss was achieved
- FLOW kidney protection occurred partly independent of metabolic improvements
- Preclinical studies show direct cellular protective effects in cultured cells (no weight context)

**Arguments against:**
- All clinical benefits could be secondary to improved metabolic milieu from weight loss
- No study has controlled for weight loss to isolate drug-specific effects
- Weight loss itself improves nearly every aging biomarker
- The magnitude of benefits correlates with degree of weight loss in most analyses
