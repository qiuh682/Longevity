## 1. Executive Summary

The period from 2023 to 2025 has witnessed a qualitative transformation in the science of aging, marked by the convergence of mechanistic insight, clinical translation, and unprecedented investment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the longevity science landscape during this pivotal era, synthesizing advances across all twelve hallmarks of aging, cataloguing the expanding pharmacological armamentarium, and assessing the regulatory and commercial infrastructure that will determine which interventions reach patients.

**Conceptual Advances.** The 2023 update to the hallmarks of aging framework by Lopez-Otin et al. [1], expanding from nine to twelve hallmarks with the addition of disabled macroautophagy, chronic inflammation (inflammaging), and dysbiosis, has reshaped the field's organizational schema. A landmark 2025 study demonstrating that somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in epigenetic age across individuals [2] has begun to unify the genomic instability and epigenetic alterations hallmarks under a shared causal mechanism. The identification of a noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway as a driver of organismal aging [3] has provided a druggable mechanistic link between DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation.

**Therapeutic Breakthroughs.** The most dramatic preclinical result of this period is the 109% extension of median remaining lifespan in aged wild-type mice by AAV-delivered OSK partial reprogramming [4]. In the clinic, the senolytic UBX1325 (foselutoclax) achieved a statistically significant 5.6-letter improvement in visual acuity from a single intravitreal injection at 48 weeks in the Phase 2b ASPIRE trial for diabetic macular edema [5]. The PEARL trial established 48-week safety data for low-dose rapamycin in 114 healthy adults aged 50-85, with sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass and general health [6]. Elamipretide (FORZINITY), a cardiolipin-stabilizing peptide, received FDA approval for Barth syndrome in September 2025, establishing the first approved mitochondria-targeting therapy [7]. The mitophagy inducer urolithin A demonstrated immune rejuvenation by expanding naive CD8+ T cells in a 28-day trial [8]. Perhaps most unexpectedly, GLP-1 receptor agonists have emerged as candidate geroprotective agents, with semaglutide producing epigenetic age reversals of 3.1 years (PCGrimAge) and 4.9 years (PhenoAge) in a clinical cohort [9].

**Near-Term Clinical Opportunities.** Five intervention classes stand out for their proximity to clinical impact: (i) UBX1325 for ophthalmic senolytic therapy; (ii) low-dose rapamycin for healthy aging, pending larger trials informed by PEARL; (iii) urolithin A, with over 25 registered clinical trials and GRAS status; (iv) elamipretide, with an established FDA approval providing a pathway for aging-related repurposing; and (v) GLP-1 receptor agonists, with massive existing safety databases and emerging evidence for multi-organ geroprotection.

**Investment and Industry.** Total longevity sector financing reached $8.49 billion across 331 deals in 2024, representing a 220% increase from 2023 [10]. Altos Labs ($3 billion), Calico (estimated $2.5-4 billion cumulative), and Retro Biosciences ($180 million seed, $1 billion Series A at $5 billion valuation) lead the well-funded startup cohort. The FDA's "reasonable expectation of effectiveness" determination for Loyal's LOY-001 in 2024 represented the first regulatory acknowledgment that lifespan extension can be a valid drug endpoint [11].

**Key Caution.** Despite remarkable scientific progress, a persistent translation gap remains. NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR) reliably raise blood NAD+ levels but have not consistently translated this into clinical endpoint improvements [12]. The Phase 3 PROTECTOR trial of RTB101 failed to demonstrate efficacy despite promising Phase 2b data [13]. The TAME trial continues to seek full funding ($45-70 million) after years of delays [14]. These experiences underscore that preclinical efficacy, even when robust, does not guarantee clinical success.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Historical Context: From Caloric Restriction to the Hallmarks Framework

The scientific study of aging has undergone a remarkable evolution over the past century, transitioning from descriptive phenomenology to a mechanistic discipline with therapeutic aspirations. The observation by McCay and colleagues in 1935 that caloric restriction extended lifespan in rats [15] established the first reproducible experimental intervention against aging, yet decades passed before the molecular mechanisms were elucidated. The identification of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway as a conserved longevity regulator in *C. elegans* by Kenyon et al. in 1993 [16], the discovery that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice by Harrison et al. in 2009 [17], and the characterization of cellular senescence as a druggable aging process by van Deursen and colleagues [18] collectively transformed aging from an inevitable decline into a potentially modifiable biological process.

The intellectual watershed came in 2013, when Lopez-Otin, Blasco, Partridge, Serrano, and Kroemer published "The Hallmarks of Aging" [19], a conceptual framework analogous to Hanahan and Weinberg's hallmarks of cancer. By organizing the diverse phenotypes of aging into nine interconnected hallmarks---genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication---the framework provided a shared vocabulary for a field that had been fractured across disciplines. The paper has since garnered over 1,000 citations per year and remains the single most referenced organizing schema in geroscience [20].

### 2.2 The 2023 Updated Framework: Twelve Hallmarks

In January 2023, the same authorship group published a landmark update, "Hallmarks of Aging: An Expanding Universe" [1], in *Cell*. This revision expanded the framework from nine to twelve hallmarks by elevating three processes to standalone status:

1. **Disabled macroautophagy** was separated from loss of proteostasis, reflecting the growing appreciation that autophagy decline affects far more than protein quality control, encompassing mitophagy, lipophagy, ER-phagy, and nucleophagy. Genetic inhibition of autophagy in young organisms recapitulates multiple aging features, while enhancement extends lifespan in virtually every model organism tested [1].

2. **Chronic inflammation (inflammaging)** was extracted from altered intercellular communication, acknowledging its status as both a consequence and a driver of virtually all other hallmarks. The cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a critical mechanistic hub connecting DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sterile inflammation [21].

3. **Dysbiosis** was introduced as an entirely new hallmark, recognizing the age-related disruption of host-microbiome symbiosis as a causal contributor to aging. Centenarian studies have revealed that exceptional longevity is associated with preserved microbial diversity and unique metabolite profiles [1].

Each hallmark satisfies three criteria established by the authors: (i) age-associated manifestation during normal aging; (ii) experimental aggravation of the hallmark accelerates aging; and (iii) therapeutic intervention against the hallmark decelerates, arrests, or reverses aging [1]. The updated framework has rapidly become the organizing principle for both academic research and drug development programs across the longevity field [20].

### 2.3 Shift from Lifespan to Healthspan Focus

A conceptual shift of equal importance has been the transition from lifespan extension as the primary metric to healthspan---the period of life spent free from serious chronic disease and disability---as the more clinically relevant and ethically compelling goal. This reframing has practical implications for trial design, endpoint selection, and regulatory strategy. The TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin), designed to enroll 3,000 adults aged 65-79, uses a composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, or death, rather than lifespan itself [14]. The development of second- and third-generation epigenetic clocks, particularly DunedinPACE [22], which measures the *rate* of biological aging rather than cumulative biological age, reflects this shift toward dynamic healthspan assessment (see Section 6).

### 2.4 Regulatory Landscape Evolution

The regulatory environment for aging interventions has evolved substantially during 2023-2025, though it remains a work in progress.

**The TAME Precedent.** The TAME trial achieved a critical regulatory milestone when the FDA agreed that aging could be a treatable indication, establishing a conceptual framework within which geroprotective drugs could seek approval [14]. However, the trial has faced persistent funding challenges ($45-70 million needed across 14 U.S. research centers), and its coordination has been transferred to ARPA-H (Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health). Notably, Eli Lilly is reportedly planning a TAME-like study incorporating a GLP-1 agonist rather than metformin, reflecting the field's shifting therapeutic landscape [14].

**Loyal and the Veterinary Pathway.** In 2024, Loyal received an FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine "reasonable expectation of effectiveness" (REE) determination for LOY-001, a growth hormone/IGF-1 axis modulator for lifespan extension in large-breed dogs [11]. This was the first time the FDA acknowledged lifespan extension as a valid drug endpoint in any species, setting a precedent that could inform human regulatory frameworks. LOY-002, an mTOR modulator for senior dog healthspan, is advancing in parallel.

**FDA Approvals of Aging-Relevant Therapies.** The September 2025 FDA approval of elamipretide (FORZINITY) for Barth syndrome [7] and the IND clearance of RLS-1496 (Rubedo Life Sciences) for actinic keratosis [23] represent additional inroads, where drugs targeting fundamental aging mechanisms gain initial approval for specific diseases, creating a platform for potential repurposing in broader aging indications.

### 2.5 Scope and Methodology of This Review

This review synthesizes peer-reviewed literature, clinical trial registry data (ClinicalTrials.gov), preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv), company disclosures, regulatory filings, and industry investment reports published between January 2023 and February 2025. We adopt the twelve-hallmark framework of Lopez-Otin et al. [1] as our organizing principle and assess each hallmark for (i) mechanistic advances, (ii) therapeutic targets identified, (iii) clinical translation progress, (iv) cross-hallmark interactions, and (v) open questions and controversies. Where possible, we provide specific quantitative data---lifespan extensions, effect sizes, p-values, sample sizes, and funding figures---to ground our assessments in evidence rather than speculation.

## 3. The Hallmarks of Aging: Recent Advances

### 3.1 Genomic Instability

#### Mechanistic Overview

Genomic instability---the progressive accumulation of DNA damage throughout the organismal lifespan---is the first and arguably most fundamental hallmark of aging. The somatic genome is continuously assaulted by exogenous agents (UV radiation, environmental mutagens) and endogenous threats (reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial metabolism, replication errors, spontaneous hydrolysis). The cell deploys an elaborate DNA damage response (DDR) network encompassing base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [1]. With age, the fidelity and capacity of these repair systems decline, leading to a net increase in somatic mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and copy number variations.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)---age-related somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (particularly in *DNMT3A*, *TET2*, and *ASXL1*)---confers clonal expansion advantages and is strongly associated with increased cardiovascular disease, hematologic malignancies, and all-cause mortality [24]. Beyond point mutations, large-scale structural variants, retrotransposon mobilization (particularly LINE-1 elements), and microsatellite instability all accumulate with age and contribute to cellular dysfunction.

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Somatic mutations drive epigenetic aging.** A landmark 2025 study by Koch et al. analyzed multimodal data from 9,331 individuals and demonstrated that CpG mutations coincide with methylation changes not only at the mutated site but with pervasive methylome remodeling extending 10 kilobases in each direction [2]. Somatic mutations explained over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals (Pearson r = 0.67 for mutation clock vs. r = 0.83 for methylation clock in predicting chronological age). This finding unifies two hallmarks---genomic instability and epigenetic alterations---under a shared mechanistic umbrella and raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks are measuring epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations [2].

**Supercharging DNA repair.** A comprehensive 2025 review in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* by Bujarrabal-Dueso et al. systematically catalogued novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing endogenous DNA repair pathways rather than merely preventing damage [25]. Approaches include small-molecule activators of PARP1, stimulation of NER through XPC modulators, augmentation of HR fidelity, and targeting the replication stress response. This review signals growing pharmaceutical interest in a hallmark that has been historically underserved by therapeutic development.

**SIRT6 overexpression.** Continued work from the Cohen laboratory at Bar-Ilan University has confirmed that SIRT6, an NAD+-dependent deacylase that promotes DNA double-strand break repair via both HR and NHEJ, extends lifespan by approximately 30% in both male and female transgenic mice [26]. SIRT6 also suppresses LINE-1 retrotransposon activity, linking chromatin maintenance to genome stability. The identification of GF-1002, a SIRT6 gene variant enriched in centenarians with demonstrated adipogenic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-tumoral properties, by TripleHelix Corporation provides a clinical development path [26].

**SGLT2 inhibitor genome protection.** A clinical study of the SGLT2 inhibitor henagliflozin (10 mg/day for 26 weeks) demonstrated measurable telomere elongation, suggesting unexpected genome-protective effects from a metabolic drug, likely mediated through reduction of oxidative DNA damage [27].

**Human DNA repair trials.** Harvard launched human clinical trials for direct DNA repair enhancement in 2024, marking a transition from preclinical research to translational medicine for this hallmark [25].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| SIRT6 activators / GF-1002 | Enhances DSB repair, suppresses retrotransposons | Preclinical (TripleHelix) |
| PARP1 modulators | Stimulates BER and SSB repair | Preclinical / early clinical |
| XPC pathway enhancers | Augments NER for UV and bulky adduct damage | Preclinical |
| NAD+ precursors (NR, NMN) | Fuels sirtuin-dependent repair | Multiple clinical trials |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Reduces oxidative DNA damage, telomere protection | Clinical (repurposing) |
| Gene therapy for DNA repair enzymes | Direct augmentation of repair capacity | Harvard trials (2024) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Genomic instability interfaces with multiple hallmarks through defined molecular mechanisms. Somatic mutations directly drive epigenetic drift, accounting for >50% of methylation age variation (Hallmark 3) [2]. Critically short telomeres trigger DDR activation and chromosomal instability via breakage-fusion-bridge cycles (Hallmark 2). Persistent DNA damage signals are a primary trigger for senescence entry via p53/p21 and p16^INK4a pathways (Hallmark 8) [1]. Cytosolic DNA fragments from unrepaired damage activate the cGAS-STING pathway, driving sterile inflammation (Hallmark 11) [21]. Mitochondrial DNA is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to limited repair capacity and proximity to ROS sources (Hallmark 7) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can DNA repair capacity be safely enhanced in humans without increasing cancer risk from aberrant repair (e.g., error-prone NHEJ)?
2. What is the relative contribution of nuclear vs. mitochondrial DNA damage to organismal aging?
3. Does repair of DNA damage reverse epigenetic clocks, given the newly established causal link [2]?
4. Can CHIP be therapeutically targeted to reduce its cardiovascular and oncogenic consequences?
5. How do somatic mutations in non-coding regulatory regions contribute to aging phenotypes?

### 3.2 Telomere Attrition

#### Mechanistic Overview

Telomeres---repetitive nucleoprotein structures (TTAGGG repeats in vertebrates) capping chromosome ends---protect genomic integrity by preventing chromosome terminus recognition as double-strand breaks. The end-replication problem ensures that telomeres shorten with each cell division in somatic cells lacking sufficient telomerase activity. When telomeres reach a critically short length, they trigger a DNA damage response driving cells into replicative senescence or apoptosis [1]. This tumor-suppressive mechanism simultaneously limits tissue regenerative capacity over time.

Telomerase, composed of the catalytic subunit TERT and the RNA template TERC, is expressed in germ cells, stem cells, and most cancers but is epigenetically silenced in the majority of somatic cells. The shelterin complex (TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, RAP1) regulates telomere structure and telomerase access. Beyond its canonical role, TERT has been shown to function as a transcription factor with extra-telomeric roles in neurogenesis, mitochondrial function, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and inflammation suppression [28].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**TERT Activating Compound (TAC).** Gorbunova, Seluanov, and colleagues conducted a high-throughput screen of over 650,000 compounds and identified a small-molecule TAC that epigenetically de-represses the endogenous TERT gene via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade [28]. Unlike direct telomerase reconstitution, TAC works by relieving epigenetic silencing, allowing cells to re-express their own TERT gene under physiological regulation. In naturally aged mice, TAC elevated TERT levels, promoted telomere synthesis, reduced cellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silenced p16^INK4a via DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC alleviated neuroinflammation, stimulated adult neurogenesis, and preserved cognitive function without increasing cancer risk [28]. This result is particularly notable because it demonstrates that TERT reactivation can reverse age-related cognitive decline through both telomere-dependent and telomere-independent (transcription factor) functions.

**TAC preclinical cognitive outcomes.** In preclinical models equivalent to humans over age 75, six months of TAC treatment led to new neuron formation in the hippocampus and significantly improved performance on cognitive tests [28].

**TERT as transcription factor.** Expanding work has confirmed TERT's role as a transcription factor affecting pathways far beyond telomere maintenance, including regulation of neurogenesis, modulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, suppression of cellular senescence and the SASP, and anti-inflammatory gene expression programs [28].

**Pharmacological and lifestyle telomere protection.** The henagliflozin finding (see Section 3.1), demonstrating telomere elongation after SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, bridges metabolic medicine and telomere biology [27]. Continued epidemiological evidence supports Mediterranean diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction as interventions that slow telomere attrition rate.

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| TAC (TERT Activating Compound) | Epigenetic TERT de-repression via MEK/ERK/AP-1 | Preclinical (2024) |
| AAV-TERT gene therapy | Direct TERT gene delivery | Preclinical (Blasco lab: lifespan extension without cancer) |
| TA-65 (cycloastragenol) | Modest telomerase activation | Nutraceutical, limited evidence |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Indirect telomere protection via oxidative stress reduction | Clinical (repurposing) |
| Danazol | TERT upregulation in telomere biology disorders | FDA-approved (off-label) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Critically short telomeres activate the DDR and can lead to breakage-fusion-bridge cycles causing chromosomal instability (Hallmark 1). Telomere shortening is a primary trigger for replicative senescence via p53 activation (Hallmark 8). Telomere attrition in tissue-resident stem cells limits their self-renewal capacity (Hallmark 9). Telomere shortening alters the epigenetic landscape of subtelomeric regions, and TERT itself has epigenetic regulatory functions (Hallmark 3). Senescent cells with critically short telomeres secrete pro-inflammatory SASP factors (Hallmark 11) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can TAC or similar TERT de-repression compounds be safely advanced to human clinical trials without oncogenic risk?
2. How do extra-telomeric TERT functions contribute to aging independently of telomere length?
3. Is there a "Goldilocks zone" for telomere length that minimizes both aging and cancer risk?
4. Can telomere lengthening reverse cellular senescence in already-senescent cells?

### 3.3 Epigenetic Alterations

#### Mechanistic Overview

Epigenetic alterations encompass changes in DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA profiles that accumulate with age without altering the underlying DNA sequence [1]. With age, the epigenome undergoes characteristic changes: global DNA hypomethylation (especially at repetitive elements, leading to retrotransposon de-repression), focal hypermethylation at CpG islands (silencing tumor suppressors and developmental genes), loss of repressive histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) at constitutive heterochromatin, and gain of activating marks at normally silenced loci. These changes erode cellular identity, compromise tissue-specific gene expression programs, and contribute to stem cell dysfunction, cellular senescence, and susceptibility to age-related diseases [1].

DNA methylation clocks---Horvath [29], Hannum [30], GrimAge [31], PhenoAge [32], and DunedinPACE [22]---have emerged as the most accurate biomarkers of biological age, capturing the cumulative impact of multiple aging processes (see Section 6 for detailed biomarker analysis). The discovery that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC---OSKM) can reprogram differentiated cells to pluripotency sparked the revolutionary insight that epigenetic aging might be reversible. Partial reprogramming---applying these factors transiently or using a subset (OSK)---has emerged as a strategy to reset the epigenome to a younger state without erasing cellular identity [1].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**AAV-OSK partial reprogramming extends lifespan by 109%.** In a study published in *Cellular Reprogramming* in 2024 by Macip et al., an AAV-delivered doxycycline-inducible OSK system (without the oncogene MYC) was administered to 124-week-old mice (equivalent to approximately 77-year-old humans) [4]. The treatment extended median remaining lifespan by 109%, representing one of the largest lifespan extensions achieved by any intervention in aged mammals. Profound epigenetic age reversal was observed in heart and liver tissues as assessed by DNA methylation clocks. This demonstrates that epigenetic rejuvenation can be applied late in life with dramatic benefit [4].

**Mesenchymal drift reversal (Cell 2025).** Research from Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte's group, published in *Cell* in 2025, revealed a pervasive "mesenchymal drift" (MD)---upregulation of mesenchymal genes and altered stromal cell composition---across over 40 human tissues during aging [33]. Increased MD correlated with disease progression, reduced patient survival, and elevated mortality risk. Critically, Yamanaka factor-induced partial reprogramming markedly reduced MD before dedifferentiation, through a partial mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Transient one-week OSKM expression suppressed MD without activating pluripotency markers such as NANOG, establishing mesenchymal drift as a fundamental aging phenotype amenable to reprogramming [33].

**SB000 single-gene rejuvenation target (Shift Bioscience).** In a June 2025 preprint, Shift Bioscience identified SB000, a single-gene target whose modulation achieves methylome and transcriptome rejuvenation across multiple cell types comparable to multi-factor reprogramming, without activating the dangerous pluripotency pathway [34]. If validated in vivo, a single-gene approach would be transformatively simpler and safer to deliver than multi-factor cocktails. The gene identity has been kept proprietary, and the preprint has generated debate pending independent replication [34].

**Single-factor reprogramming approaches.** Multiple preprints in 2025 explored individual transcription factors or small molecules that can partially reset the epigenome, moving the field away from the complexity and risk of multi-factor delivery [34].

**Chemical reprogramming.** Small-molecule cocktails mimicking the effects of Yamanaka factors are under active development, offering the advantages of dosing control, reversibility, and conventional pharmacokinetics [35].

**ICE mouse model (Yang et al. 2023).** David Sinclair's group at Harvard published the Inducible Changes to the Epigenome (ICE) mouse model in *Cell*, demonstrating that disrupting the epigenome accelerates aging and that OSK-mediated reprogramming reverses it, supporting the "Information Theory of Aging" [36]. However, this model has attracted both significant attention and some methodological criticism.

**Major industry investment.** Altos Labs ($3 billion funding) is building the largest epigenetic reprogramming research operation globally, assembling a team including Nobel laureates Shinya Yamanaka and Jennifer Doudna, and field pioneers Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, Steve Horvath, and Manuel Serrano [37]. Retro Biosciences ($1 billion Series A, 2025) is pursuing reprogramming alongside autophagy and plasma-based approaches [37]. Turn Biotechnologies has developed the ERA (Epigenetic Reprogramming of Aging) platform using mRNA delivery of reprogramming factors [37]. Life Biosciences has announced human clinical trials expected in early 2026 for an ocular application [37]. NewLimit ($80-100 million) is combining machine learning with epigenetic reprogramming, focusing on T cell rejuvenation [37]. Shift Bioscience received $16 million in seed funding in October 2024 [34].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Partial reprogramming (OSK) via AAV | Epigenome reset, lifespan extension | Preclinical; Altos Labs safety testing Aug 2025 |
| SB000 single-gene target | Single-factor rejuvenation | Preclinical (Shift Bioscience, June 2025) |
| Chemical reprogramming cocktails | Small-molecule epigenome reset | Preclinical |
| ERA platform (mRNA delivery) | Transient reprogramming factor expression | IND-enabling (Turn Biotechnologies, TRN-001 targeting 2026) |
| HDAC inhibitors | Restore histone acetylation patterns | Approved (oncology), repurposing explored |
| Alpha-ketoglutarate | TET enzyme cofactor, demethylation support | Clinical trials (ABLE trial, Singapore, n=120) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

The interplay between genomic instability and epigenetic alterations is now quantified: somatic mutations directly drive >50% of epigenetic age variation [2]. DNA damage at epigenetic regulatory elements (enhancers, promoters) permanently alters the epigenome. Senescent cells exhibit a characteristic epigenomic signature (SAHF) and SASP gene de-repression; partial reprogramming can reverse senescence markers (Hallmark 8). Epigenetic drift erodes stem cell identity and self-renewal gene expression programs; reprogramming can rejuvenate aged stem cells (Hallmark 9). Epigenetic silencing of chaperone and autophagy genes contributes to proteostasis collapse (Hallmark 4). Reprogramming reactivates telomerase in somatic cells and can restore telomere length (Hallmark 2) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal "dose" of reprogramming---how far can the epigenome be reset without risking teratoma formation or loss of cellular identity?
2. Can epigenetic reprogramming be targeted to specific tissues or cell types in vivo?
3. Is single-factor reprogramming (e.g., SB000) as effective as multi-factor approaches across different tissues?
4. What are the long-term safety profiles of partial reprogramming---does it increase cancer risk over years?
5. How do epigenetic clocks mechanistically relate to the biological processes they measure, given the new evidence for somatic mutation as a driver [2]?
6. No reprogramming-based therapy has been approved for humans as of 2025---what are the key barriers to clinical translation?

### 3.4 Loss of Proteostasis

#### Mechanistic Overview

Proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is the integrated cellular network that maintains the proteome in its functional state, encompassing protein synthesis (ribosomal quality control), folding (chaperone systems including HSP70, HSP90, and co-chaperones), conformational maintenance, and degradation (ubiquitin-proteasome system, chaperone-mediated autophagy, macroautophagy) [1]. With age, every arm of this network deteriorates: chaperone expression declines, proteasome activity decreases, autophagy flux slows, and the burden of damaged and misfolded proteins increases.

Age-dependent protein aggregation underlies the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid-beta, tau), Parkinson's disease (alpha-synuclein), Huntington's disease (polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin), and ALS (SOD1, TDP-43, FUS). Transcription factor EB (TFEB) has emerged as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression, and its nuclear translocation is impaired with age [38].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**AA-20: mTORC1-independent autophagy enhancer.** Tammineni et al. reported in *PNAS* (2025) the discovery of AA-20, a novel small-molecule autophagy enhancer that promotes cellular cleanup through a TFEB/HLH-30-dependent mechanism without inhibiting mTORC1 [38]. This mechanistic distinction from rapamycin is critical: most known autophagy inducers work by inhibiting mTOR, which has broad effects on cell growth and immune function. AA-20 specifically activates TFEB nuclear translocation, upregulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy genes. In *C. elegans*, AA-20 extended lifespan in wild-type nematodes but not in autophagy-deficient mutants, confirming mechanism specificity. AA-20 also reduced polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner [38].

**TFEB as therapeutic hub.** Overexpression studies have confirmed that TFEB activation inhibits age-related protein aggregation, enhances neuronal function, and improves muscle stem cell (satellite cell) function, positioning TFEB as a central therapeutic node for proteostasis restoration [38].

**SINE compounds for nuclear TFEB enrichment.** Inhibition of XPO1/CRM1, the exportin responsible for shuttling TFEB out of the nucleus, enriches nuclear TFEB and enhances autophagy-lysosome gene expression. SINE compounds such as selinexor (FDA-approved for multiple myeloma) represent a repurposing opportunity for proteostasis enhancement [38].

**Rapamycin confirms proteostasis benefits.** Rapamycin supplementation was confirmed to inhibit age-related protein aggregation across multiple tissues, consistent with its role as an mTOR inhibitor that de-represses autophagy. Combined with the PEARL trial safety data (see Section 3.6), this supports rapamycin as a multi-hallmark intervention [6].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| AA-20 | TFEB activation without mTORC1 inhibition | Preclinical (*PNAS* 2025) |
| SINE compounds (XPO1 inhibitors) | Nuclear TFEB enrichment | FDA-approved (selinexor, oncology); repurposing |
| Rapamycin / rapalogs | mTORC1 inhibition, autophagy induction | Clinical (PEARL trial completed) |
| HSP90 modulators | Enhanced chaperone capacity | Preclinical |
| Small-molecule chaperones (TUDCA, 4-PBA) | Chemical chaperoning of misfolded proteins | Clinical (liver disease); repurposing explored |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Proteostasis and autophagy are deeply intertwined---autophagy is the primary clearance mechanism for aggregated proteins; AA-20 bridges both Hallmarks 4 and 5. Hyperactive mTOR (Hallmark 6) increases protein synthesis rates, overwhelming chaperone capacity while suppressing autophagic clearance. Mitochondrial protein quality control (mitophagy, UPR^mt) is a specialized arm of proteostasis whose failure leads to damaged mitochondrial accumulation (Hallmark 7). Senescent cells exhibit impaired proteostasis (Hallmark 8). Epigenetic silencing of chaperone genes contributes to proteostasis decline (Hallmark 3) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can TFEB activation be achieved safely in humans without disrupting lysosomal function?
2. Can proteostasis restoration reverse existing protein aggregates (e.g., amyloid plaques) or only prevent new aggregation?
3. How does tissue-specific proteostasis differ, and do different organs require different therapeutic strategies?

### 3.5 Disabled Macroautophagy

#### Mechanistic Overview

Macroautophagy (hereafter "autophagy") was elevated to a standalone hallmark in the 2023 framework update [1], separated from loss of proteostasis. This promotion reflects the growing recognition that autophagy decline with age affects far more than protein quality control---it impairs mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy), lipid droplet catabolism (lipophagy), ER homeostasis (ER-phagy), nuclear envelope maintenance (nucleophagy), and pathogen clearance (xenophagy) [1].

The age-associated decline in autophagy enables accumulation of damaged organelles and is causally linked to aging: genetic inhibition of autophagy in young organisms recapitulates multiple aging features, while genetic or pharmacological enhancement extends lifespan in virtually every model organism tested [1]. Key regulators include the ATG family of proteins, the ULK1 initiation complex, the Beclin-1/VPS34 nucleation complex, and the LC3 conjugation machinery. TFEB and TFE3 are master transcriptional activators of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, and their nuclear exclusion by mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation represents a critical control point [38].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**AA-20 (PNAS 2025).** As detailed in Section 3.4, AA-20 activates autophagy through TFEB/HLH-30 without inhibiting mTORC1, extending *C. elegans* lifespan and representing a mechanistically distinct approach from rapamycin [38].

**Autophagy modulators for Alzheimer's disease.** A 2024 review in *Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience* catalogued autophagy-targeting compounds advancing toward clinical use in Alzheimer's disease, including trehalose, spermidine, and lithium, with several in early-phase clinical trials [39].

**Retro Biosciences autophagy platform.** Retro Biosciences (backed by $1 billion Series A) is pursuing autophagy enhancement as one of three pillars of its longevity platform (alongside partial reprogramming and plasma-based therapies), bringing substantial resources to the field [37].

**Spermidine and trehalose clinical evidence.** Continued clinical and epidemiological data support spermidine (an autophagy inducer via eIF5A hypusination and EP300 acetyltransferase inhibition) in promoting healthy aging. The POLYCAD trial randomized 187 elderly patients with coronary artery disease to 24 mg/day spermidine or placebo, with recruitment completed in August 2025 and co-primary endpoints including left ventricular mass, peak VO2, lean mass, and hsCRP [40]. Earlier cognitive studies have shown mixed results: the SmartAge trial of approximately 100 older adults with subjective cognitive decline showed trends toward improved memory with spermidine supplementation (approximately 1.2 mg/day from wheat germ extract for 3 months), reaching significance in some secondary endpoints [41], while a subsequent 100-participant trial over 12 months showed no benefit [40].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| AA-20 | TFEB activation (mTORC1-independent) | Preclinical (*PNAS* 2025) |
| Rapamycin / rapalogs | mTORC1 inhibition, autophagy de-repression | Clinical (PEARL trial) |
| Spermidine | Autophagy via eIF5A hypusination, EP300 inhibition | POLYCAD trial (n=187, completed recruitment) |
| Trehalose | TFEB activation | Preclinical, early clinical (Alzheimer's) |
| Lithium (low-dose) | Autophagy via IMPase inhibition (mTOR-independent) | Clinical (psychiatric use); repurposing |
| Beclin-1 peptide mimetics | Enhanced autophagosome nucleation | Preclinical |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Autophagy is the primary mechanism for clearing protein aggregates, and its decline directly worsens proteostasis failure (Hallmark 4). Mitophagy decline leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria (Hallmark 7). mTOR is the central nexus: nutrient excess activates mTORC1, which phosphorylates and inactivates TFEB and ULK1, suppressing autophagy (Hallmark 6). Autophagy-competent cells may undergo autophagic cell death rather than persisting as senescent cells (Hallmark 8). Autophagy of damaged nuclear components (nucleophagy) and cytosolic DNA helps maintain genome integrity (Hallmark 1) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Why does autophagy decline with age---is it primarily transcriptional, post-translational, or structural (lysosomal dysfunction)?
2. Can mTORC1-independent autophagy activators (e.g., AA-20) provide the lifespan benefits of rapamycin without immunosuppressive side effects?
3. Is there a risk of excessive autophagy causing tissue damage in certain contexts?

### 3.6 Deregulated Nutrient-Sensing

#### Mechanistic Overview

Nutrient-sensing pathways evolved to coordinate growth, metabolism, and stress resistance with nutrient availability. Four key axes are central: (1) the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway; (2) mTOR, integrating amino acid, energy, and growth factor signals; (3) AMPK, sensing low energy states; and (4) sirtuins, sensing NAD+ levels [1]. With age, IIS and mTOR tend toward constitutive activation, while AMPK and sirtuin activity decline, promoting anabolism over catabolism and accelerating damaged macromolecule accumulation. Caloric restriction, which has extended lifespan in every organism tested from yeast to primates, works largely by rebalancing these pathways toward the "fasted" state [1].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**PEARL Trial (rapamycin in healthy aging).** The Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity (PEARL) trial (NCT04488601) was a 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT enrolling 114 healthy adults aged 50-85, testing compounded rapamycin at 5 mg or 10 mg weekly versus placebo [6]. Key findings included: (i) safety and tolerability over 48 weeks with no serious adverse events attributable to treatment; (ii) women on 10 mg showed improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain scores; (iii) the 5 mg group showed improved emotional well-being and general health perceptions; (iv) improved bone mineral content was observed in men. An important caveat: the compounded rapamycin formulation had approximately one-third the bioavailable concentration compared to commercial (Rapamune) formulations, meaning effective doses were lower than nominal [6]. A comprehensive 2025 review in *Frontiers in Aging* by Vellai et al. concluded there is "no clear clinical evidence" that preclinical benefits have yet fully translated to humans, highlighting the need for larger and longer trials [42].

**Rapamycin + acarbose combination.** In NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP) mouse studies, the combination of rapamycin with acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) produced up to a 36.6% increase in median lifespan, one of the largest pharmacological lifespan extensions reported [17].

**Low-dose rapamycin immune enhancement.** A study of 1 mg/day rapamycin for 8 weeks in elderly subjects demonstrated enhanced immune function and reduced infections, challenging the assumption that mTOR inhibition is uniformly immunosuppressive [43]. The landmark Mannick et al. Phase 2a trial (NCT01227135) of low-dose everolimus in 218 healthy older adults had previously shown a 20% increase in influenza vaccine antibody titers and reduced PD-1 expression on T cells [44], and these findings continue to underpin the therapeutic rationale for mTOR modulation in aging.

**Oxford rapamycin-senescence study.** A study from Oxford demonstrated that low-dose rapamycin reduces senescent cell burden in older adults, providing human evidence that mTOR inhibition activates senescent cell clearance mechanisms---a senomorphic (and possibly senolytic) effect [45].

**TAME Trial update.** The Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial continues to seek full funding ($45-70 million) and has been transferred to ARPA-H coordination. Emerging data has introduced uncertainty about metformin's benefits in non-diabetic populations: some studies suggest it may blunt exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations [46]. A 2024 study in *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* showed metformin decreased protein age by an average of 6.41 years in cynomolgus monkeys over 3.3 years of treatment [47], supporting the biological rationale, while a 2025 critical review in *Ageing Research Reviews* highlighted "emerging uncertainty on the anti-aging potential of metformin" in non-diabetic humans [48]. Eli Lilly is planning a TAME-like study using a GLP-1 agonist, reflecting the field's shifting interest toward incretin-based interventions [14].

**RTB101 Phase 3 failure.** The PROTECTOR Phase 3 trial (NCT03693612) of RTB101 (a catalytic mTOR inhibitor) monotherapy in 652 elderly volunteers failed to reduce respiratory infections compared to placebo, despite promising Phase 2b combination data (30.6% reduction with RTB101 + everolimus) [13]. This highlighted the challenge of translating mTOR pathway modulation to clinical endpoints.

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Rapamycin (low-dose, intermittent) | mTORC1 inhibition | PEARL (Phase 2 completed); larger trials needed |
| Rapamycin + acarbose | Dual mTOR + glucose absorption inhibition | Preclinical (ITP: 36.6% lifespan extension) |
| Everolimus (low-dose) | mTORC1 inhibition, immune rejuvenation | Phase 2 completed; EVERLAST ongoing |
| Metformin | AMPK activation, complex I inhibition | TAME trial (Phase 3, funding in progress) |
| Acarbose | Alpha-glucosidase inhibition | ITP data; available as generic |
| Canagliflozin (SGLT2i) | Glucose handling, possible AMPK activation | ITP data (lifespan extension in males) |
| NAD+ precursors (NR, NMN) | Sirtuin activation via NAD+ repletion | Multiple clinical trials (see Section 3.7) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

mTOR is the master switch: its inhibition directly activates autophagy via TFEB and ULK1 de-repression (Hallmark 5). Hyperactive mTOR increases protein synthesis rates while suppressing autophagic clearance, overwhelming proteostasis (Hallmark 4). AMPK activation promotes mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis; its decline with age impairs mitochondrial quality control (Hallmark 7). mTOR signaling in senescent cells drives the SASP; rapamycin suppresses SASP secretion (senomorphic effect; Hallmark 8). Nutrient-sensing pathways regulate NF-kappaB-driven inflammation (Hallmark 11) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal rapamycin dosing regimen for healthy aging in humans?
2. Does the PEARL trial's compounded formulation issue (one-third bioavailability) mean the true effective dose was significantly lower than intended?
3. Can rapamycin + acarbose be safely translated to humans?
4. What is the role of GLP-1 agonists as nutrient-sensing modulators in aging (see Section 3.11)?

### 3.7 Mitochondrial Dysfunction

#### Mechanistic Overview

Mitochondria serve as primary generators of cellular ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and as signaling hubs for apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, innate immunity (via mtDNA sensing), and metabolite production. With age, mtDNA mutations accumulate, OXPHOS complex activity declines, ROS production rises, mitochondrial dynamics shift toward fragmentation, and mitophagy becomes impaired [1]. Cardiolipin, a phospholipid unique to the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for cristae structure and OXPHOS supercomplex assembly, undergoes oxidation with age, representing a key biophysical driver of mitochondrial decline [49].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Urolithin A (Mitopure): extensive clinical program.** Timeline/Amazentis has built the most comprehensive clinical program for any mitophagy enhancer, with over 25 registered human trials representing more than $50 million in R&D investment and 80+ global patents [50]. Key results include:

- *Muscle health:* A randomized controlled trial demonstrated a 12% improvement in hamstring muscle strength after 4 months of supplementation at 500 mg or 1000 mg daily (P = 0.027 and P = 0.029 vs. placebo, respectively), with improved aerobic endurance and reduced plasma acylcarnitines and CRP [50].
- *MitoImmune study (Nature Aging, 2025):* In 50 healthy middle-aged adults, 1000 mg/day urolithin A for 4 weeks expanded naive-like CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 percentage points; P = 0.0437), increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 pp; P = 0.0061), and reduced inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), demonstrating immune rejuvenation through improved mitochondrial fitness [8].
- *CLARITY study:* A major trial enrolling 650 participants to assess effects on brain health and cognitive function, with completion expected in March 2026 [50].

**Elamipretide (FORZINITY): FDA approval.** Elamipretide received FDA approval in September 2025 for Barth syndrome under accelerated approval, establishing the first FDA-approved mitochondria-targeting peptide therapy [7]. Elamipretide (D-Arg-dimethylTyr-Lys-Phe-NH2) selectively binds cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, stabilizing cristae structure, maintaining OXPHOS supercomplex assembly, reducing electron leak and ROS production, and enhancing ATP generation [49]. Preclinical data demonstrate that elamipretide reverses age-related mitochondrial redox stress, improves exercise tolerance in aged animals, and restores cardiac mitochondrial function, providing a pathway for potential repurposing in age-related mitochondrial decline [49]. Clinical trials across cardiovascular (PROGRESS-HF), mitochondrial myopathy (MMPOWER-3), and ophthalmic (ReCLAIM) indications have generated additional safety and efficacy data [49].

**NAD+ precursors: clinical disappointments.** NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) declines approximately 50% between ages 40 and 60, driven by increased CD38 expression, increased PARP activity, and decreased NAMPT expression [51]. NMN and NR, the two principal NAD+ precursors, have reliably raised blood NAD+ levels across multiple trials but have not consistently translated this into clinical endpoint improvements. A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (513 participants, 250-2000 mg/day NMN) found no significant benefit on fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or lipid profiles [52]. A 2025 meta-analysis concluded NMN and NR offer "minimal benefits" for sarcopenia and muscle performance in older adults [12]. An NR trial in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increased blood NAD+ and showed modest NR-associated reduction in epigenetic age (PhenoAge and GrimAge) but did not alter cognition [53]. This "NAD+ paradox"---blood NAD+ goes up, but clinical benefits are not reliably observed---raises fundamental questions about the NAD+ depletion theory of aging.

Notable exceptions: NMN (250 mg/day, 10 weeks) improved muscle insulin sensitivity in prediabetic postmenopausal women as measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp [54]. NMN (250 mg/day, 12 weeks) maintained walking speed and improved sleep quality in 60 older adults [55]. CD38 inhibitors (targeting the primary NADase responsible for age-related NAD+ decline) remain at the preclinical stage but represent a conceptually upstream approach---maintaining NAD+ by preventing degradation rather than supplementing precursors [51].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Urolithin A (Mitopure) | PINK1/Parkin mitophagy induction | 25+ clinical trials; GRAS status; commercial |
| Elamipretide (SS-31) | Cardiolipin stabilization, cristae maintenance | FDA approved (Barth syndrome, Sept 2025) |
| NMN | NAD+ precursor, sirtuin activation | Multiple trials; inconsistent clinical endpoints |
| NR | NAD+ precursor | Multiple trials; NAD+ paradox noted |
| CD38 inhibitors (78c) | Prevent NAD+ degradation | Preclinical |
| CoQ10 / MitoQ | Electron transport support | Nutraceutical / clinical |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Cytosolic mtDNA from damaged mitochondria activates cGAS-STING and NLRP3 inflammasomes, driving inflammaging---a critical mechanistic link (Hallmark 11) [21]. Impaired mitophagy (Hallmark 5) is a primary cause of damaged mitochondrial accumulation. AMPK senses mitochondrial energetic output; NAD+ levels regulate sirtuins; mTOR regulates mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC-1alpha (Hallmark 6). mtDNA is highly vulnerable to oxidative damage with limited repair capacity (Hallmark 1). Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger senescence via ROS-mediated DNA damage (Hallmark 8). Stem cells rely on tightly regulated mitochondrial metabolism (Hallmark 9) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can urolithin A's clinical benefits translate to brain health (CLARITY trial)?
2. Can elamipretide be repurposed for general age-related mitochondrial dysfunction?
3. Why does raising NAD+ levels not consistently improve clinical endpoints---is the issue tissue penetrance, dosing, or a flawed underlying hypothesis?

### 3.8 Cellular Senescence

#### Mechanistic Overview

Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest accompanied by resistance to apoptosis, metabolic reprogramming, chromatin reorganization, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)---a complex mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta), chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and growth factors that collectively alter the tissue microenvironment [1]. While senescence serves beneficial roles in tumor suppression and wound healing, the accumulation of senescent cells with age drives tissue dysfunction through paracrine SASP signaling. Two primary therapeutic strategies have emerged: **senolytics** (selective killing of senescent cells) and **senomorphics** (SASP suppression), with a third approach---**senoblockers** (prevention of senescence entry)---gaining traction [56].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

Cellular senescence has become one of the most therapeutically advanced hallmarks, with over 30 clinical trials completed, underway, or planned as of 2025 [57].

**UBX1325/foselutoclax (Unity Biotechnology).** The Phase 2b ASPIRE trial in diabetic macular edema (DME) demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325, a BCL-xL inhibitor, led to a 5.6-letter improvement in ETDRS visual acuity compared to sham at week 48 (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7) [5]. The 48-week durability from a single injection is remarkable and demonstrates that localized senolytic therapy can have lasting tissue-level effects. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation, and no systemic thrombocytopenia was observed (confirming local delivery avoids systemic BCL-xL inhibition) [5]. Results were published in *NEJM Evidence*, and Unity secured $55 million in Series C funding led by Foresite Capital in 2024.

**Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q).** The STAMINA study, a 12-week pilot in 12 adults aged 65+ with MCI and slow gait, demonstrated safety, and TNF-alpha reduction correlated with improvements in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (2.0-point increase, 95% CI: 0.1-4.0, in those with lowest baseline scores) [58]. A Phase 2 osteoporosis trial reported results in 2024. The SToMP-AD Phase 2 trial at Wake Forest University is actively testing intermittent D+Q in early-stage Alzheimer's disease [59]. A pilot protocol for testing D+Q in age-related mental health conditions was accepted in February 2025 [59].

**Fisetin.** In a Mayo Clinic study of 536 long-COVID patients, 64% of the 44 receiving fisetin reported significant symptom alleviation, representing one of the largest senolytic interventional datasets [60]. A 2025 mouse study demonstrated that fisetin improved frailty indices and grip strength comparable to genetic clearance of p16^INK4a-positive senescent cells, pharmacologically validating fisetin as equivalent to genetic senescent cell elimination [60]. The Phase II TROFFi trial in frail breast cancer survivors is ongoing, the STOP-Sepsis trial tested fisetin in 220 elderly patients with sepsis (recruitment completed 2025), and NCT06431932 is characterizing fisetin's senolytic pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers [60].

**Navitoclax (ABT-263): topical delivery.** Topical navitoclax application on aged mouse skin (December 2024) demonstrated localized senescent cell clearance with skin rejuvenation effects, offering a delivery route that avoids systemic thrombocytopenia, navitoclax's primary dose-limiting toxicity due to BCL-xL inhibition in platelets [61].

**Senolytic CAR T cells.** Amor et al. (2024) demonstrated in *Nature Aging* that CAR T cells targeting uPAR on senescent cells provided prophylactic and long-lasting efficacy against age-related metabolic dysfunction in mice [62]. A single low dose provided protection lasting over one year---far exceeding the durability of small-molecule senolytics---representing a "one-and-done" senolytic approach.

**Rubedo Life Sciences RLS-1496.** The FDA cleared the IND application for RLS-1496, a first-in-class selective GPX4 modulator targeting pathological senescent cells via ferroptosis, for a Phase 1b/2a study in actinic keratosis (September 2025). An EMA-cleared trial for plaque psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and skin aging began in May 2025 [23]. This represents one of the first purpose-built senolytics to enter clinical development through a regulatory pathway.

**Dorian Therapeutics senoblockers.** Dorian is developing compounds that prevent cells from entering senescence while reactivating tissue regeneration in already-senescent neighboring cells, representing a paradigm shift from clearance to prevention [56].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| UBX1325 (foselutoclax) | BCL-xL inhibitor (intravitreal) | Phase 2b completed (ASPIRE; *NEJM Evidence*) |
| D+Q | Tyrosine kinase + PI3K/BCL-2 inhibition | Phase 1/2 (multiple: AD, frailty, IPF, bone) |
| Fisetin | BCL-2/BCL-xL, PI3K/Akt, NF-kappaB | Phase 2 (long-COVID, frailty, sepsis) |
| Navitoclax (topical) | BCL-2/BCL-xL/BCL-w | Preclinical (topical delivery) |
| RLS-1496 | GPX4 modulation (ferroptosis) | IND cleared (Sept 2025) |
| Senolytic CAR T (uPAR) | Immune-mediated clearance | Preclinical (*Nature Aging* 2024) |
| Senoblockers (Dorian) | Prevent senescence entry | Preclinical |
| Rapamycin (senomorphic) | SASP suppression via mTOR inhibition | Clinical (see Section 3.6) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

DNA damage is a primary senescence trigger; persistent DDR foci maintain the senescent state (Hallmark 1). Critically short telomeres activate p53-dependent replicative senescence (Hallmark 2). The SASP is a major driver of inflammaging; senescent cell clearance reduces systemic inflammation (Hallmark 11). SASP factors impair stem cell function in a paracrine manner (Hallmark 9). Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci and SASP gene de-repression involve major epigenomic changes (Hallmark 3). Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger senescence; senescent cells exhibit altered mitochondrial metabolism sustaining the SASP (Hallmark 7) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal senolytic dosing regimen: intermittent "hit-and-run" vs. continuous therapy?
2. Can senolytic CAR T cells be safely deployed in humans without autoimmunity risk?
3. How do we selectively target detrimental senescent cells while preserving beneficial senescence?
4. Can UBX1325 ASPIRE results be replicated in other ophthalmic diseases (AMD, glaucoma)?
5. What biomarkers best track senescent cell burden in humans for clinical trial endpoints?

### 3.9 Stem Cell Exhaustion

#### Mechanistic Overview

Tissue homeostasis and regeneration depend on resident stem and progenitor cell populations. With age, these pools decline in number, functional capacity, and regenerative output---a process termed stem cell exhaustion [1]. This manifests as impaired wound healing, immunosenescence, sarcopenia, thinning intestinal epithelium, and declining neurogenesis. Five hallmark characteristics of aged stem cells have been identified: (1) altered quiescence depth; (2) changed self-renewal (shift toward asymmetric or symmetric commitment divisions); (3) altered cell fate (lineage bias, e.g., myeloid skewing in hematopoietic stem cells); (4) compromised stress resilience; and (5) reduced population heterogeneity (clonal dominance) [63].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Senescence-resistant cells halt aging in macaques (Cell 2025).** In a landmark study, Liu et al. created genetically engineered senescence-resistant cells (SRCs) by overexpressing FOXO3 in human mesenchymal progenitor cells [64]. Biweekly intravenous SRC infusions (2 x 10^6 cells/kg) to elderly macaques over 44 weeks produced multi-system rejuvenation across 61 tissue types and 10 physiological systems. Machine-learning aging clocks estimated neuronal cells were biologically reverted by 6-7 years, oocytes by 5 years. Enhanced brain architecture, cognitive function, and reproductive function were observed. No tumors, immune overreactions, or serious adverse events occurred [64]. This is the most comprehensive primate rejuvenation study published to date.

**Rejuvenate Bio RJB-0402.** Rejuvenate Bio received $4 million from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) in July 2024 for development of RJB-0402, a gene therapy approach targeting multiple aging pathways in stem cells [65].

**Comprehensive rejuvenation framework.** A systematic framework of rejuvenation approaches for aged stem cells has been established, encompassing exercise (stem cell mobilization across tissues), caloric restriction and fasting (intestinal stem cell rejuvenation via mTOR/AMPK rebalancing), senolytic clearance of SASP-producing niche cells, autophagy restoration, epigenetic reprogramming, and circulating blood factors from heterochronic parabiosis [63].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| SRCs (FOXO3-engineered) | Replace aged cells with senescence-resistant cells | Preclinical (*Cell* 2025, macaques) |
| RJB-0402 (Rejuvenate Bio) | Multi-pathway gene therapy in stem cells | Preclinical ($4M CIRM grant, 2024) |
| Partial reprogramming (OSK) | Epigenetic rejuvenation of aged stem cells | Preclinical (see Section 3.3) |
| Senolytics (stem cell niche) | Clear senescent niche cells | Clinical (see Section 3.8) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Senescent stem cells lose regenerative capacity; SASP from senescent niche cells creates a hostile microenvironment (Hallmark 8). Telomere shortening limits stem cell replicative capacity (Hallmark 2). Epigenetic drift erodes stem cell identity genes (Hallmark 3). mTOR hyperactivation depletes stem cell pools via premature differentiation (Hallmark 6). The stem cell niche is regulated by systemic signals that change with age (Hallmark 10). Autophagy is essential for stem cell quiescence-activation cycling (Hallmark 5) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can SRC therapy be translated from macaques to humans---what are the immunological barriers?
2. Is it better to rejuvenate existing aged stem cells or replace them with engineered young cells?
3. What is the cancer risk of reactivating stem cell proliferation in aged tissues with accumulated mutations?

### 3.10 Altered Intercellular Communication

#### Mechanistic Overview

Cells do not age in isolation. Aging organisms exhibit profound changes in hormones, growth factors, cytokines, extracellular vesicles, and direct cell-cell contact signals [1]. The heterochronic parabiosis model---joining the circulatory systems of young and old mice---has been transformative: old mice sharing circulation with young mice show rejuvenation of brain, muscle, liver, and bone, while young mice exposed to old blood exhibit accelerated aging [66].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Young blood vs. dilution debate.** A vigorous scientific debate has emerged regarding the mechanism of parabiosis benefits. The traditional interpretation holds that young blood contains rejuvenating factors. The alternative hypothesis, championed by Irina and Michael Conboy (UC Berkeley), proposes that the primary benefit comes from dilution or neutralization of harmful age-elevated proteins in old blood [66]. Neutral blood exchange experiments (replacing old plasma with saline-albumin solution) have shown substantial rejuvenation, supporting the dilution hypothesis. This has profound therapeutic implications: it may be simpler and safer to remove harmful factors (via plasmapheresis) than to identify and supplement beneficial ones [66].

**Alkahest plasma fractions.** Alkahest, cofounded by Tony Wyss-Coray, is developing plasma fraction-based therapeutics, with some fractions having completed Phase 2 trials for Alzheimer's disease (GRF6019) [67].

**Elevian and GDF11.** Elevian, founded by Lee Rubin (Harvard), continues developing GDF11 supplementation, with recent findings that GDF11 attenuates age-related knee degeneration in mice [68]. However, controversy persists: some studies indicate that GDF11 hinders muscle regeneration by inhibiting satellite cell activation, while others show beneficial effects on vasculature, brain, and bone [68].

**GLP-1 agonists as systemic communication modulators.** Semaglutide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists are emerging as potent modulators of systemic intercellular signaling (see Section 3.11 for detailed discussion) [69].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Plasma dilution / neutral blood exchange | Remove age-elevated harmful factors | Preclinical / early clinical |
| Young plasma fractions (Alkahest) | Supply rejuvenating circulating factors | Phase 2 (GRF6019, Alzheimer's) |
| GDF11 (Elevian) | Declining trophic factor supplementation | Preclinical |
| GLP-1 agonists | Systemic anti-inflammatory signaling | Clinical (multiple indications) |
| Klotho protein | Anti-aging circulating factor | Preclinical |

#### Open Questions

1. Is dilution of harmful aged factors more effective than supplementation of young factors?
2. Can specific rejuvenating plasma fractions be manufactured synthetically?
3. Is GDF11 beneficial or harmful for muscle regeneration?

### 3.11 Chronic Inflammation (Inflammaging)

#### Mechanistic Overview

Chronic inflammation, or "inflammaging," was elevated to a standalone hallmark in the 2023 update [1]. Unlike acute inflammation, inflammaging is a persistent, low-grade inflammatory state characterized by elevated circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CRP), activated innate immune cells, and impaired resolution. Sources include the SASP, cytosolic DNA activating cGAS-STING, gut barrier dysfunction, adipose tissue inflammation, dysregulated trained immunity, and declining regulatory T cell function [1]. The cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a critical mechanistic hub: cGAS detects cytosolic dsDNA (from mitochondrial leakage, nuclear envelope breakdown, retrotransposon activation) and produces cGAMP, activating STING, which drives type I interferon responses and NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation [21].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**cGAS-STING as central inflammaging driver.** Gulen et al. (2023) in *Nature* demonstrated that cytosolic DNA from perturbed mitochondria in aged microglia activates cGAS, driving neuroinflammation and cognitive decline [21]. Pharmacological inhibition of STING with H-151 improved muscle strength and memory in aged mice and reduced microgliosis [21]. Faria et al. (2025) in *PNAS* identified a noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway as a direct driver of cellular and organismal aging, distinct from the classical interferon response [3]. This noncanonical pathway activates NF-kappaB through an alternative mechanism, with important implications for drug design: inhibitors targeting canonical STING activation may be insufficient for age-related conditions [3]. Novel indole-based STING inhibitors and STING degraders (PROTACs) are in development [70]. cGAS-STING has been identified as a therapeutic target in osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and intervertebral disc degeneration [70].

**GLP-1 agonists as anti-inflammaging agents.** This has been the most unexpected therapeutic development of the 2023-2025 period:

- *Epigenetic age reversal in HIV:* In a 32-week randomized trial with 84 participants with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, semaglutide produced remarkable epigenetic age reversals: PCGrimAge -3.1 years (P = 0.007), PhenoAge -4.9 years (P = 0.004), and DunedinPACE slowed by 9% (P = 0.01). Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart [9].
- *MACE reduction independent of weight loss:* The SELECT trial (NCT03574597; n = 17,604) demonstrated that semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 20% (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.90, P < 0.001) and all-cause death by 19% (HR 0.81) through mechanisms independent of weight loss [71].
- *EVOKE/EVOKE+ trials for Alzheimer's:* Phase 3 trials are underway testing semaglutide for Alzheimer's disease, based on the neuroinflammation hypothesis [69].
- *Nature Biotechnology commentary:* A 2025 perspective titled "Are GLP-1s the first longevity drugs?" highlighted the multi-system geroprotective effects, with speakers from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly engaging the longevity community at the ARDD conference in Copenhagen [69].
- *Key caveat:* No healthy-population longevity trials have been conducted. Most evidence comes from metabolically unhealthy or HIV-positive cohorts [9].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| H-151 / novel STING inhibitors | Block cGAS-STING-driven inflammation | Preclinical |
| STING degraders (PROTACs) | Selective STING degradation | Preclinical |
| Semaglutide / GLP-1 agonists | Multi-mechanism anti-inflammatory | Approved (T2D/obesity); Phase 3 (Alzheimer's) |
| Senolytics (D+Q, fisetin) | Remove SASP-producing senescent cells | Clinical (see Section 3.8) |
| Rapamycin (senomorphic) | Suppress SASP via mTOR inhibition | Clinical (see Section 3.6) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

The SASP from senescent cells is a primary source of inflammaging (Hallmark 8). Cytosolic mtDNA from damaged mitochondria activates cGAS-STING (Hallmark 7). Nuclear DNA fragments and retrotransposon-derived DNA activate cGAS-STING (Hallmark 1). Gut barrier dysfunction increases systemic endotoxin exposure (Hallmark 12). mTOR promotes NF-kappaB-driven inflammation (Hallmark 6) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can cGAS-STING inhibition be safely deployed long-term without compromising antiviral/antitumor immunity?
2. Are GLP-1 agonists truly geroprotective agents, or are their epigenetic clock effects limited to specific populations (HIV, obesity)?
3. What is the optimal level of inflammation for healthy aging---complete suppression may impair immune surveillance?

### 3.12 Dysbiosis

#### Mechanistic Overview

Dysbiosis---age-related disruption of host-microbiome symbiosis---was added as a new hallmark in the 2023 update [1]. The human gut microbiome collectively influences metabolism, immune function, barrier integrity, neurotransmitter production, and epigenetic regulation through metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, tryptophan metabolites). With aging, characteristic changes occur: reduced alpha-diversity, expansion of pro-inflammatory pathobionts, decline of beneficial commensals (e.g., *Bifidobacterium*, *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*), reduced SCFA production (particularly butyrate), gut barrier dysfunction ("leaky gut"), and altered bile acid metabolism [1].

Studies of centenarians and supercentenarians reveal that exceptional longevity is associated with preserved or increased microbial diversity and elevated abundance of unique secondary bile acid-producing taxa, suggesting microbiome maintenance may be both a marker and mediator of healthy aging [72].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Centenarian microbiome studies.** Multiple studies (2023-2025) confirmed that long-lived individuals show increased microbial diversity and enrichment of specific taxa with antimicrobial and health-promoting properties [72].

**"Biome-aging" concept.** The bidirectional relationship between microbiome deterioration and organismal aging has been formalized as "biome-aging," with comprehensive reviews published in *Genome Medicine*, *Journal of Biomedical Science*, and *Frontiers in Aging* in 2025 [73].

**Dietary interventions.** Fiber-rich and PUFA-rich diets increase microbial diversity and SCFA production in elderly populations. Polyphenol supplementation selectively promotes beneficial taxa. Mediterranean diet adherence in elderly populations is consistently associated with preserved microbial diversity and reduced frailty [73].

**Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).** Preclinical studies demonstrated that FMT from young donors to aged recipients reverses age-related gut barrier dysfunction, reduces systemic inflammation, and improves cognitive function in aged mice [73].

**Urolithin A as microbiome-mitochondria bridge.** Urolithin A, the mitophagy inducer discussed in Section 3.7, is produced by gut bacteria from dietary ellagitannins, exemplifying how microbiome function directly impacts mitochondrial health---a cross-hallmark interaction with therapeutic relevance [50].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Mediterranean/high-fiber diet | Increase diversity, SCFA production | Clinical evidence (lifestyle) |
| FMT (young to aged) | Microbiome restoration | Preclinical, early clinical |
| *Akkermansia muciniphila* | Mucin-layer restoration | Clinical trials (pasteurized form) |
| Postbiotics (butyrate, propionate) | Direct metabolite delivery | Nutraceutical |
| Next-gen probiotics | Engineered strains | Preclinical / early clinical |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Gut barrier dysfunction allows microbial products (LPS) to enter systemic circulation, activating TLR4 and NF-kappaB (Hallmark 11). Microbial metabolites (SCFAs, tryptophan derivatives) are systemic signaling molecules influencing distant organs (Hallmark 10). SCFAs activate AMPK, connecting to nutrient-sensing pathways (Hallmark 6). Butyrate functions as an HDAC inhibitor, directly influencing host epigenetics (Hallmark 3). Urolithin A production connects microbiome function to mitophagy (Hallmark 7) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Is there an "optimal" microbiome composition for healthy aging, or does it vary by individual genetics and geography?
2. Can FMT safely and durably rejuvenate the aged microbiome in humans?
3. What role does the non-bacterial microbiome (fungi, viruses, archaea) play in aging?

## 4. Pharmacological Interventions: Evidence Review

The pharmacological targeting of aging mechanisms has advanced from theoretical possibility to clinical reality over the period 2023--2025. This section evaluates the evidence base for each major intervention class, emphasizing human data where available and contextualizing preclinical findings with appropriate caveats regarding translational uncertainty. Throughout, we note both positive and null results, as the field's maturation depends critically on honest appraisal of failures alongside successes.

### 4.1 Senolytics and Senomorphics

Cellular senescence, now firmly established as a causal driver of age-related pathology [1], represents one of the most actively targeted hallmarks of aging. Senolytic compounds---agents that selectively eliminate senescent cells by disrupting senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs)---have progressed through multiple clinical trials since the first human proof-of-concept in 2019 [2].

**Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q).** The combination of the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib (100 mg) with the flavonoid quercetin (1000--1250 mg), administered intermittently for 3 consecutive days per cycle, remains the most extensively studied senolytic regimen. Dasatinib targets ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases preferentially in senescent preadipocytes, while quercetin inhibits BCL-2/BCL-xL and PI3K/AKT survival pathways more effectively in senescent endothelial and bone marrow stem cells [3]. The STAMINA pilot study enrolled 12 older adults (age >= 65) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and slow gait speed, administering D+Q over 12 weeks. The regimen was safe, with no serious adverse events; mean MoCA scores increased by 2.0 points (95% CI: 0.1--4.0) in those with lowest baseline scores, and reductions in TNF-alpha correlated with cognitive improvements [4]. The SToMP-AD Phase 2 trial (NCT04685590) at Wake Forest University is evaluating intermittent D+Q in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (n ~ 20), with CSF senescence markers and brain MRI as primary endpoints; interim data confirm acceptable tolerability [5]. A Phase 1 trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) demonstrated feasibility and tolerability (PMID: 36857968) [6]. An osteoporosis Phase 2 trial (NCT06018467) at Odense University Hospital is active with results expected in 2026, and a Phase 2 pilot protocol for mental disorders was accepted in February 2025 (PMC12120425) [7]. However, an emerging safety concern arose in 2024 when kidney damage was observed in an acute folic acid nephropathy model, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and monitoring [8].

**Fisetin.** Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) was identified as the most potent senolytic flavonoid in screening studies, demonstrating approximately 50% greater senolytic potency than quercetin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [9]. In a Mayo Clinic study of 536 long-COVID patients, 44 who received fisetin reported a 64% rate of significant symptom alleviation [10]. The TROFFi Phase II RCT in frail breast cancer survivors is active (ASCO 2024 abstract: JCO.2024.42.16_suppl.TPS1645) [11]. The STOP-Sepsis trial completed recruitment of 220 elderly sepsis patients in 2025 [12], and additional trials are evaluating fisetin for healthy aging (NCT07195318) and vascular function in older adults (NCT06133634) [13]. A critical limitation is fisetin's poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism and low aqueous solubility, which may explain the inconsistency between in vitro potency and clinical effect sizes [14]. The AFFINITY trial (NCT03675724) of fisetin 20 mg/kg/day for frailty in older women showed mixed results---some SASP markers improved while others did not reach statistical significance [15].

**Navitoclax (ABT-263).** Navitoclax is a potent BH3-mimetic BCL-2/BCL-xL/BCL-w inhibitor (Ki < 1 nM) whose senolytic activity derives from the critical dependence of senescent cells on BCL-xL for survival [16]. Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia---arising because BCL-xL is essential for platelet survival---has precluded systemic aging-indication development. Recent work has focused on circumventing this toxicity: topical application on aged mouse skin demonstrated efficacy in December 2024 [17], and prodrug strategies (galactose-conjugated Nav-Gal, PZ-15227) preferentially target beta-galactosidase-expressing senescent cells while sparing platelets [18]. Navitoclax has also shown efficacy in glioma and diffuse midline glioma models (2025) [19]. No dedicated aging clinical trials are registered as of early 2025.

**UBX1325 (Foselutoclax).** Unity Biotechnology's intravitreal BCL-xL inhibitor represents the most clinically advanced senolytic program. In the ASPIRE Phase 2b trial, a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325 in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) achieved a gain of 5.6 ETDRS letters versus sham at week 48 (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7), published in *NEJM Evidence* [20]. The 48-week durability from a single injection is remarkable. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation, and no systemic thrombocytopenia was observed, confirming that local delivery avoids systemic BCL-xL inhibition [20]. However, the earlier BEHOLD Phase 2 trial (NCT04857996, n = 63) failed its primary endpoint of BCVA improvement at week 24, illustrating the importance of trial design---the longer 48-week follow-up in ASPIRE captured durability effects that the 24-week BEHOLD did not [21]. Unity secured $55M Series C funding in 2024 to advance the program [22].

**RLS-1496 (Rubedo Life Sciences).** RLS-1496 is a first-in-class GPX4 modulator that targets the ferroptosis vulnerability of pathological senescent cells. The FDA cleared its IND application in September 2025 for a Phase 1b/2a study in actinic keratosis, and the EMA cleared a clinical trial for plaque psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and skin aging that began in May 2025 [23]. This novel mechanism---distinct from BCL-2 family targeting---broadens the senolytic armamentarium.

**Senolytic CAR T Cells.** Amor et al. demonstrated that CAR T cells targeting uPAR on senescent cells provided prophylactic protection against age-related metabolic decline lasting over one year from a single low dose in mice, far exceeding the durability of small-molecule senolytics [24]. This paradigm shift from repeated small-molecule administration to "one-and-done" immunotherapy-based senolysis has significant implications for clinical translation, though manufacturing complexity and cost remain barriers.

**Safety and Therapeutic Windows.** The senolytic field confronts a fundamental safety-efficacy tradeoff: the most potent agents (navitoclax) carry the greatest toxicity. Strategies to improve therapeutic windows include intermittent "hit-and-run" dosing (D+Q), local delivery (UBX1325 intravitreal), prodrug activation in senescent cells (Nav-Gal), and novel targets (GPX4 modulation, CAR T). More than 30 senolytic clinical trials have been completed or are underway as of early 2025 [25].

### 4.2 mTOR Pathway Modulators

Inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) remains the most robustly replicated pharmacological lifespan extension intervention in mammals [26]. The period 2023--2025 has seen the first rigorous randomized controlled trial data in healthy aging adults.

**Rapamycin.** The PEARL trial (NCT04488601) is the landmark study of this period: a 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT enrolling 114 healthy adults aged 50--85 who received 5 mg or 10 mg compounded rapamycin weekly versus placebo (PMC12074816) [27]. The trial confirmed that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin was safe and well-tolerated, with adverse events similar across groups. Efficacy signals were modest and sex-specific: women on 10 mg showed improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain; the 5 mg group showed improved emotional well-being and general health self-reports [27]. A critical limitation was that compounded rapamycin had approximately one-third the bioavailability of commercial formulations, potentially underestimating effects [27]. A comprehensive 2025 review in the *Aging* journal concluded that there is "no clear clinical evidence" that preclinical benefits translate to humans, while acknowledging that clinical data remain preliminary [28].

The combination of rapamycin with acarbose achieved a 36.6% increase in median lifespan in mice in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP)---one of the largest pharmacological lifespan extensions ever recorded [29]. No human combination trial has been initiated.

An Alzheimer's Phase 1 pilot study of rapamycin published in *Nature Communications Medicine* (2025) is exploring mTOR inhibition in neurodegeneration [30]. The Dog Aging Project TRIAD trial (NCT04614428) is testing low-dose rapamycin in 580 middle-aged companion dogs with lifespan as the primary endpoint, following a pilot showing improved diastolic cardiac function [31].

**Everolimus.** The paradigm-shifting Mannick et al. 2014 trial demonstrated that low-dose everolimus (0.5 mg/day or 5 mg weekly) enhanced influenza vaccine response by approximately 20% in 218 healthy older adults (age >= 65), simultaneously reducing PD-1 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells [32]. The 2018 follow-up combining everolimus with RTB101 reduced respiratory tract infections by 30.6% (p = 0.008) in 264 elderly volunteers [33]. The EVERLAST trial (NCT05835999) is evaluating low-dose everolimus in older adults with completion expected late 2026 [34]. A sirolimus trial for preventing functional decline (NCT05237687) is recruiting in 2025 [35].

**Dose-Response and the Immunosuppression Paradox.** The counter-intuitive finding that low-dose mTOR inhibition enhances rather than suppresses immune function [32] has reshaped the field's understanding of this drug class. However, the RTB101 PROTECTOR Phase 3 trial (NCT03693612, n ~ 652) demonstrated that the catalytic mTOR inhibitor RTB101 as monotherapy failed to reduce respiratory infections in elderly adults, leading to a ~75% stock decline for resTORbio [36]. This failure underscores that not all modes of mTOR modulation are equivalent and that combination strategies may be necessary.

| Agent | Trial | n | Duration | Key Finding | Ref |
|-------|-------|---|----------|-------------|-----|
| Rapamycin 5/10 mg weekly | PEARL | 114 | 48 weeks | Safe; modest sex-specific improvements | [27] |
| Rapamycin + acarbose | ITP (mice) | -- | Lifetime | 36.6% median lifespan extension | [29] |
| Everolimus 0.5 mg/day | Mannick 2014 | 218 | 6 weeks | ~20% vaccine titer increase | [32] |
| Everolimus + RTB101 | Mannick 2018 | 264 | 16 weeks | 30.6% infection reduction (p=0.008) | [33] |
| RTB101 monotherapy | PROTECTOR Phase 3 | 652 | 16 weeks | **Failed** primary endpoint | [36] |

### 4.3 NAD+ Metabolism

NAD+ declines approximately 50% between ages 40 and 60, driven by increased CD38 expression, elevated PARP activity, and decreased NAMPT expression [37]. Restoring NAD+ levels through precursor supplementation has been a major focus of both academic research and the consumer supplement industry.

**NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide).** NMN is converted to NAD+ in a single enzymatic step by NMNATs. A 12-week RCT in 60 older adults showed that 250 mg/day NMN significantly increased blood NAD+, improved walking speed, and enhanced sleep quality versus placebo (PMID: 38789831) [38]. A February 2025 trial demonstrated that 350 mg/day liposomal NMN significantly increased NAD+ compared with non-liposomal formulations over 4 weeks [39]. However, a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (250--2000 mg/day, 513 participants) found no significant benefit on fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or lipid profiles, concluding that "an exaggeration of the benefits of NMN supplementation may exist in the field" [40]. A 2025 meta-analysis further confirmed minimal benefits for sarcopenia and muscle performance in adults over 60 [41].

**NR (Nicotinamide Riboside).** NR requires an additional enzymatic step (via NRK1/NRK2) compared with NMN to generate NAD+. An RCT in older adults with MCI found that NR (escalated to 1 g/day over 10 weeks) was safe, raised blood NAD+ significantly, and crossed the blood-brain barrier, but did not improve cognition on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (PMC10828186) [42]. A modest NR-associated reduction in epigenetic age (PhenoAge and GrimAge) was observed [42]. A long-COVID RCT (2025) evaluated 2000 mg/day for 24 weeks in 58 participants, published in *Lancet eClinicalMedicine* [43]. A peripheral artery disease pilot (n = 8) showed improved cerebrovascular response [44]. The 2025 consensus assessment is that NMN and NR offer minimal benefits for muscle mass and function in adults over 60 [41].

**CD38 Inhibitors.** CD38 is the primary NADase responsible for the majority of age-related NAD+ decline [37]. Small-molecule CD38 inhibitors (compound 78c and analogs) have reversed age-related NAD+ decline and improved metabolic function in mice [45], but no CD38 inhibitor clinical trials for aging exist as of early 2025. This approach---preserving NAD+ by preventing degradation rather than supplying precursors---is conceptually upstream of NMN/NR but remains preclinical.

**The NAD+ Paradox.** A critical unresolved question is why reliably raising blood NAD+ has not consistently translated into clinical endpoint improvements. This "NAD+ paradox" raises fundamental questions about the NAD+ depletion theory of aging [42]. Possible explanations include inadequate tissue-level NAD+ repletion despite elevated blood levels, compartmentalization of NAD+ metabolism, and the theoretical concern that increased NAD+ could fuel cancer cell metabolism---though NMN and NR also enhance DNA repair and immune surveillance [37].

---

### 4.4 Metformin

Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide) occupies a unique position in the longevity pharmacopeia: it is the only candidate geroprotective agent with 60+ years of clinical safety data, approximately 150 million current users, and a cost of ~$4/month [46].

**TAME Trial Update.** The Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial (NCT02432287, PI: Nir Barzilai) is a Phase 3 multi-center, double-blind RCT of metformin 1500 mg/day versus placebo in 3,000 non-diabetic adults aged 65--79, with a composite primary endpoint of first cardiovascular event, cancer, dementia, or death over 6 years [47]. Funding of $45--70M is needed; the NIA set aside $5M, and the trial is now handled within the ARPA-H framework. Eli Lilly is planning a TAME-like study incorporating a GLP-1 agonist arm [47]. Completion is estimated at 2027--2028. The regulatory milestone---FDA agreement that aging can be an indication---is arguably the trial's most important contribution to date, regardless of its eventual outcome [47].

**MILES Trial.** The completed MILES pilot (NCT02432287) provided molecular evidence that metformin reverses age-related gene expression changes in muscle and adipose tissue [47].

**Epidemiological Evidence versus RCT Uncertainty.** The widely cited Bannister et al. (2014) observation that diabetics on metformin lived 15% longer than matched non-diabetic controls generated enormous enthusiasm [48]. However, a 2025 critical review in *Ageing Research Reviews* highlighted methodological limitations of this and other early studies, describing "emerging uncertainty on the anti-aging potential of metformin" in non-diabetic populations [49]. In contrast, a 2024 primate study in *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* showed that 3.3 years of metformin treatment in healthy cynomolgus monkeys decreased protein age by 6.41 years and DNA methylation age across five organ systems (-6.1 years frontal lobe, -5.11 years lung, -4.9 years kidney, -3.95 years liver, -2.65 years skin) [50].

**Mechanisms Beyond Glucose Control.** Metformin's proposed geroprotective mechanisms extend well beyond AMPK activation: mTORC1 inhibition, mitochondrial complex I modulation, anti-inflammatory effects (NF-kB, IL-6, TNF-alpha reduction), gut microbiome modulation (*Akkermansia muciniphila* enrichment), epigenetic effects, and anti-senescence activity [46].

**Exercise Blunting Controversy.** The observation that metformin may attenuate exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations and hypertrophic gains remains controversial and may limit enthusiasm for its use in physically active older adults [46].

---

### 4.5 Epigenetic Reprogramming

Epigenetic reprogramming represents the most radical---and potentially the most potent---approach to aging reversal, premised on the hypothesis that aging is fundamentally an epigenetic process that can be reversed by resetting the epigenome to a younger state without full dedifferentiation [51].

**Yamanaka Factors: OSK in Aged Mice.** Macip et al. (2024) delivered AAV9-encoded doxycycline-inducible OSK (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4---omitting the oncogene c-Myc) to 124-week-old wild-type mice. Cyclic induction produced a 109% increase in median remaining lifespan with improved health condition, alongside profound age reversal in heart and liver as assessed by DNA methylation clocks (PubMed: 38381405) [52]. This is among the most dramatic lifespan extension results ever reported from a pharmacological or genetic intervention.

**Mesenchymal Drift Reversal.** A 2025 *Cell* paper from the Belmonte laboratory revealed that a pervasive "mesenchymal drift" (MD)---upregulation of mesenchymal genes across >40 human tissues---is a fundamental aging phenotype correlating with disease progression and mortality. Transient 1-week OSKM expression suppressed MD through a partial mesenchymal-epithelial transition without activating pluripotency markers (e.g., NANOG) [53].

**Single-Factor Approaches.** Shift Bioscience reported that a novel single-gene target, SB000, achieves methylome and transcriptome rejuvenation comparable to OSKM without activating the pluripotency pathway (bioRxiv, June 2025) [54]. If validated in vivo, this would be transformatively simpler and safer than multi-factor cocktails, though the gene identity remains proprietary and independent replication is pending.

**Chemical Reprogramming Alternatives.** Small-molecule cocktails that mimic Yamanaka factor effects are under investigation as potentially safer approaches, reviewed in *Aging* journal (2024) [55].

**Safety Concerns.** Tumorigenesis risk is the major obstacle. c-Myc is a known oncogene, and even the OSK triad carries risk if expression is not precisely controlled in duration and level [52]. Dedifferentiation concerns---the possibility of losing cell identity---further constrain in vivo application.

**Company Programs.** The commercial landscape is rapidly expanding:

| Company | Funding | Approach | Status (2025) |
|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Altos Labs | $3B (Bezos, Milner, ARCH) | Cellular rejuvenation | Human safety testing from Aug 2025 |
| Retro Biosciences | $180M seed + $1B Series A | Partial reprogramming, autophagy | First human trial (Australia) by end 2025 |
| Turn Biotechnologies | $300M HanAll deal | ERA mRNA-based transient reprogramming | IND-enabling TRN-001, target 2026 |
| Life Biosciences | Multiple rounds | Epigenetic reprogramming (ocular) | Human trials expected early 2026 |
| NewLimit | $105M (Brian Armstrong) | Epigenetic reprogramming | Research stage |
| Shift Bioscience | $16M seed (Oct 2024) | SB000 single-gene; AI virtual cell | SB000 data expected June 2025 |

### 4.6 GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

The emergence of GLP-1 receptor agonists as potential geroprotective agents was not predicted by traditional aging biology frameworks and may represent the most consequential development in longevity pharmacology during 2023--2025.

**Semaglutide and Epigenetic Aging.** In a 32-week RCT of 45 semaglutide-treated and 39 placebo participants with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy (medRxiv 2025), semaglutide significantly decreased multiple epigenetic aging clocks: PCGrimAge (-3.1 years, P = 0.007), GrimAge V1 (-1.4 years, P = 0.02), GrimAge V2 (-2.3 years, P = 0.009), PhenoAge (-4.9 years, P = 0.004), and DunedinPACE (-0.09 units, approximately 9% slower aging pace, P = 0.01) [57]. Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart [57]. The caveat that HIV patients may not be generalizable to healthy populations is significant.

**MACE Reduction.** The SELECT trial (NCT03574597, n = 17,604) demonstrated that semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly reduced MACE by 20% (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.72--0.90, P < 0.001) and all-cause death by 19% (HR 0.81) in overweight/obese adults with established cardiovascular disease but without diabetes [58]. This cardiovascular benefit appears independent of weight loss magnitude, suggesting direct vascular or anti-inflammatory geroprotective mechanisms [58].

**Alzheimer's Disease.** The EVOKE and EVOKE+ Phase 3 trials are testing semaglutide for early Alzheimer's disease, evaluating whether GLP-1 agonism provides neuroprotection beyond metabolic effects [59].

**"Are GLP-1s the First Longevity Drugs?"** A 2025 *Nature Biotechnology* perspective reported on ARDD conference presentations where Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly representatives proposed that GLP-1 receptor agonists may be the first longevity drugs, citing accumulated evidence for benefit across cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and reduced all-cause mortality [60].

**Mechanistic Hypotheses Beyond Weight Loss.** Proposed geroprotective mechanisms include systemic inflammation reduction (CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha), immune cell function modulation, direct CNS effects via brain GLP-1 receptors, and reduction of amyloid plaques and alpha-synuclein aggregates in preclinical Alzheimer's and Parkinson's models [61]. The concern that muscle mass loss accompanying weight loss may be detrimental in older adults requires careful monitoring [62].

### 4.7 Mitochondrial-Targeted Therapies

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging that is increasingly amenable to pharmacological intervention [1].

**Urolithin A (Mitopure).** Urolithin A, a gut-microbial metabolite of ellagitannins that activates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, has accumulated one of the most robust clinical evidence bases in the longevity supplement space, with 25+ registered human trials and $50M+ in R&D [63]. A 4-month RCT demonstrated a 12% improvement in hamstring muscle strength at both 500 mg and 1000 mg doses (P = 0.027 and P = 0.029 vs. placebo, respectively) with reduced plasma acylcarnitines and CRP (PMC9133463) [64]. The MitoImmune study (2025, *Nature Aging*) administered 1000 mg/day urolithin A for 4 weeks to 50 adults; treatment expanded naive CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 pp, P = 0.0437), increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 pp, P = 0.0061), and reduced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta [65]. The CLARITY brain health study (650 participants) is ongoing with completion expected March 2026 [66].

**SS-31/Elamipretide (FORZINITY).** Elamipretide is a mitochondria-targeting tetrapeptide that selectively binds cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, stabilizing cristae structure, reducing ROS generation, and enhancing ATP production [67]. The FDA approved elamipretide as FORZINITY in September 2025 for Barth syndrome under accelerated approval, establishing it as the first FDA-approved mitochondria-targeting peptide therapy [68]. Clinical trials have been conducted across heart failure (PROGRESS-HF), primary mitochondrial myopathy (MMPOWER-3), and age-related macular degeneration (ReCLAIM) [67]. This approval creates a regulatory pathway for broader aging-related applications.

**Mitochondrial Transplantation.** Emerging research on direct mitochondrial transplantation---transferring functional mitochondria to dysfunctional cells---remains at the preclinical stage but represents a conceptually distinct approach to restoring mitochondrial quality [67].

### 4.8 Emerging and Novel Interventions

**Taurine.** The 2023 Singh et al. *Science* paper identified taurine deficiency as a driver of aging across species (PMID: 37289866) [69]. Taurine supplementation in mice increased lifespan by 10% (male) to 12% (female); life expectancy at 28 months increased 18--25% (~7--8 human-year equivalents). In *C. elegans*, lifespan extended 10--23%. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected telomerase activity, enhanced mitochondrial function, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging [69]. In humans, lower taurine levels correlated with higher BMI and adverse metabolic profiles; however, no large-scale aging RCTs exist as of early 2025, and 2024 follow-up studies noted large interindividual variation [70].

**GlyNAC (Glycine + N-Acetylcysteine).** The Sekhar laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine has demonstrated that GlyNAC supplementation (glycine 100 mg/kg/day + NAC 100 mg/kg/day) simultaneously corrects multiple aging hallmarks. A 16-week RCT in 24 older adults (n = 12 GlyNAC, n = 12 placebo) found that GlyNAC corrected glutathione deficiency, reduced oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function, lowered inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha), improved insulin resistance, endothelial function, body composition, gait speed, grip strength, cognition, and exercise capacity (PMID: 35975308) [71]. A 36-week pilot showed that 24 weeks of GlyNAC reversed multiple age-associated defects including cognition, but stopping for 12 weeks allowed defects to return, suggesting ongoing supplementation is necessary [72]. Despite remarkably broad effects, all studies remain small; larger confirmatory trials are warranted.

**Spermidine.** Spermidine is among the most potent known autophagy inducers, operating through eIF5A hypusination and EP300/CBP acetyltransferase inhibition [73]. Cognitive effects have been inconsistent: the SmartAge trial (n ~ 100, 12 months) showed trends toward improved memory in some secondary endpoints but no clear primary benefit [74]. The POLYCAD trial randomized 187 elderly patients with coronary artery disease 1:1 to 24 mg/day spermidine or placebo, with co-primary endpoints of left ventricular mass, peak VO2, appendicular lean mass, and hsCRP; recruitment completed August 2025 [75]. A 40 mg/day dose was safe and well-tolerated in healthy older men over 28 days [76].

**Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG).** This TCA cycle metabolite and caloric restriction mimetic reduced biological age by an average of 8 years over 7 months in an open-label pilot of calcium-AKG 1000 mg/day (TruAge DNA methylation clock), though the study lacked a placebo control (n ~ 42) [77]. The ABLE trial in Singapore is enrolling 120 adults aged 40--60 for 1 g sustained-release calcium-AKG over 6 months with 3-month follow-up---one of the most rigorous AKG aging trials to date [78]. A 2025 preclinical study demonstrated that AKG restored long-term potentiation and associative memory in APP/PS1 Alzheimer's model mice [79].

**Gene Therapies.** AAV-Klotho prolonged mouse lifespan by 19.7%, improved bone health, muscle regeneration, and reduced neuroinflammation (*Molecular Therapy*, 2025) [80]. Intranasal AAV-Follistatin extended median mouse lifespan by approximately 30% with improved physical performance (*PNAS*, 2022) [81]. SIRT6 overexpression extended lifespan by 30% in both sexes, preserving hepatic glucose output and promoting de novo NAD+ synthesis (*Nature Communications*, 2021) [82]. A high-throughput screen of >650,000 compounds identified TAC (TERT Activating Compound), which epigenetically de-represses endogenous TERT via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade, promoting telomere synthesis and neurogenesis in aged mice without cancer risk (*Cell*, 2024) [83]. Combined Klotho + Follistatin clinical trials for healthy adults have been initiated, and Minicircle Bio expects Klotho gene therapy to reach clinical stage in 2026 [80].

**Plasma Exchange.** The field is divided between the Alkahest approach (young plasma fractions for neurodegeneration) and the Conboy hypothesis that benefits of heterochronic parabiosis derive primarily from dilution of pro-aging factors rather than positive rejuvenating factors in young blood [84]. Elevian is developing GDF11-based therapies, though controversy persists---some studies show GDF11 hinders rather than promotes muscle regeneration [85]. Lyfspn is planning clinical trials of therapeutic plasmapheresis [84].

**Autophagy Modulators.** AA-20, a novel TFEB-dependent autophagy enhancer, extended *C. elegans* lifespan without mTORC1 inhibition---a critical distinction from rapamycin that may avoid immunosuppressive side effects (*PNAS*, 2025) [86]. Trehalose activates autophagy via TFEB, and SINE compounds (XPO1 inhibitors like selinexor) trap TFEB in the nucleus to enhance autophagic gene transcription [87].

---

### 4.9 Combination and Synergistic Approaches

**Rapamycin + Acarbose.** The 36.6% median lifespan extension achieved by this combination in the ITP remains a benchmark for pharmacological synergy [29]. The rationale is complementary mechanism: mTORC1 inhibition (rapamycin) combined with postprandial glucose blunting (acarbose) addresses both nutrient-sensing and metabolic hallmarks simultaneously.

**Multi-Hallmark Targeting Rationale.** The expanded hallmarks framework [1] implies that maximal geroprotective benefit will require targeting multiple orthogonal pathways. Convergent mechanisms---autophagy (rapamycin, spermidine, urolithin A, AA-20), inflammation (metformin, semaglutide, STING inhibitors), and NAD+ metabolism (NMN, NR, CD38 inhibitors, SIRT6)---suggest logical combination partners [88].

**Biomarker-Guided Polypharmacy.** The emergence of organ-specific proteomic aging profiles [89] and validated epigenetic clocks [90] enables a new paradigm of personalized polypharmacy: selecting interventions based on which hallmarks and organs show the greatest acceleration in individual patients. This remains largely theoretical but is the logical endpoint of current biomarker development.

| Combination | Rationale | Evidence Level |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Rapamycin + acarbose | mTOR + glucose sensing | Preclinical (36.6% lifespan, mice) |
| D+Q (senolytic combo) | Broad senescent cell coverage | Phase 2 clinical |
| Klotho + Follistatin | Anti-aging gene + muscle preservation | Early clinical |
| CD38 inhibitor + NMN/NR | Prevent NAD+ degradation + supply precursor | Preclinical |
| Senolytic + senomorphic | Clear + suppress remaining senescent cells | Conceptual |

## 5. Biomarkers and Aging Clocks

The development of validated biomarkers of biological aging has arguably been as important as the development of interventions themselves, providing the measurement tools without which aging clinical trials cannot be efficiently conducted. The period 2023--2025 has seen the maturation of epigenetic clocks from academic curiosities to clinical trial endpoints, the emergence of multi-omic and AI-powered approaches, and growing---but still incomplete---regulatory acceptance.

---

### 5.1 Epigenetic Clocks

DNA methylation clocks are the most promising tools for biological age estimation among all potential biomarkers studied, with age-related methylation sites constituting approximately 28% of the human genome [90].

**Generation 1: Chronological Age Predictors.** The Horvath multi-tissue clock (2013) uses 353 CpG sites across an elastic net regression model trained on 8,000 samples from 51 cell types, achieving a median absolute error of ~3.6 years [91]. The Hannum blood-based clock (2013) uses 71 CpGs optimized for blood with median absolute error of ~4.9 years [92]. Both predict chronological age rather than biological aging per se; epigenetic age acceleration (EAA = DNAm age minus chronological age) of +5 years is associated with ~15--20% increased mortality risk [91]. Their primary limitation as clinical trial endpoints is relatively low sensitivity to interventions.

**Generation 2: Mortality- and Phenotype-Trained Clocks.** PhenoAge (Levine, 2018) employs a two-step approach: first calculating a composite "phenotypic age" from 9 clinical biomarkers (albumin, creatinine, glucose, CRP, lymphocyte %, mean cell volume, RDW, alkaline phosphatase, WBC count) plus chronological age, then building a 513-CpG methylation predictor of this phenotypic age [93]. PhenoAge acceleration significantly predicts mortality (HR ~1.04--1.05 per year of acceleration) and is substantially superior to first-generation clocks [93].

GrimAge (Lu and Horvath, 2019; GrimAge2, 2022) uses 1,030 CpGs to generate methylation surrogates for 7 plasma proteins (adrenomedullin, beta-2 microglobulin, cystatin C, GDF-15, leptin, PAI-1, TIMP-1) plus smoking pack-years [94]. GrimAge acceleration is the strongest epigenetic predictor of all-cause mortality among all published clocks (HR ~1.07--1.10 per year of acceleration), also strongly predicting coronary heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and COPD [94]. A 2025 NIA review confirmed GrimAge as the best mortality predictor among epigenetic clocks [90]. GrimAge has shown response to caloric restriction (CALERIE trial), weight loss, exercise, and smoking cessation, and is being used as a primary endpoint in the PEARL trial and other longevity trials [94].

**Generation 3: Pace of Aging.** DunedinPACE (Belsky, 2022) represents a conceptual advance: rather than estimating cumulative biological age, it measures the *rate* of aging using 173 CpGs trained on the Dunedin Longitudinal Study---1,037 individuals followed from age 3 to 45 with 19 repeated measures of organ-system function [95]. A DunedinPACE value of 1.0 indicates aging at the normative rate; each 0.1-unit increase is associated with ~10--15% increased mortality risk [95]. Its key advantage is sensitivity to interventions: the CALERIE 2-year caloric restriction trial reduced DunedinPACE by ~2--3% [95]. Framingham Heart Study data demonstrated that DunedinPACE predicts cognitive decline over follow-up [95]. DunedinPACE is increasingly considered the preferred endpoint for shorter aging clinical trials (detecting changes in 6--12 months) [96].

---

### 5.2 Proteomic and Metabolomic Clocks

**Deep Aging Clocks (DACs).** AI-powered aging clocks that overcome linear model limitations by capturing non-linear complex interactions have been reviewed in *Ageing Research Reviews* (2025) [97]. Deep learning approaches integrate epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, microbiome data, and medical imaging to produce more comprehensive biological age estimates than any single-omic approach [97].

**OMICmAge and SYMPHONYAge.** Multi-omic integration clocks, including TruDiagnostic's OMICmAge, combine DNA methylation with metabolomic and proteomic data to create composite aging estimates [98]. Organ-specific proteomic clocks developed by Oh and Wyss-Coray (2023) identified distinct aging signatures for 11 major organs from plasma proteins, revealing that ~1 in 5 apparently healthy adults aged 50+ had significantly accelerated aging in at least one organ, and that multi-organ accelerated aging conferred ~50% increased mortality risk [89].

---

### 5.3 Composite Biomarker Panels

Multi-modal approaches combining omic layers with wearable sensor data are emerging as the next frontier. GeroSense, developed by Gero AI, integrates wearable-derived physical activity data with biological markers to estimate both biological age and resilience (the ability to recover from perturbations) [99]. The conceptual shift from static "biological age snapshots" to dynamic "aging trajectory monitoring" parallels the DunedinPACE philosophy of measuring rate rather than state.

Functional biomarkers retain critical importance: gait speed (<0.8 m/s associated with significantly elevated mortality; each 0.1 m/s increase associated with ~12% mortality reduction) [100] and grip strength (each 5 kg decline associated with ~15--20% increased mortality) [101] remain among the strongest single predictors of adverse outcomes in older adults and are accepted by the FDA as functional clinical trial endpoints.

---

### 5.4 Clinical Utility and Validation Status

**GrimAge versus DunedinPACE: Comparative Performance.** The field consensus is evolving toward using GrimAge/GrimAge2 for longer trials (>12 months) where cumulative biological age change is the target, and DunedinPACE for shorter trials (6--12 months) where detecting changes in the rate of aging is prioritized [96]. In head-to-head comparisons, GrimAge is the stronger mortality predictor in cross-sectional analysis, while DunedinPACE is more responsive to short-term interventions [94, 95].

**Commercial Testing Landscape.**

| Provider | Platform | Key Clocks Reported | Sample Type | Approx. Cost |
|----------|----------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| TruDiagnostic | Illumina EPIC array | Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge2, DunedinPACE, DNAmTL, OMICmAge | Blood | $229--$499 |
| Elysium (Index) | Illumina array | Biological age, rate of aging | Saliva | ~$299 |
| Tally Health | Custom panel | CheekAge (proprietary) | Buccal swab | ~$229 |
| GlycanAge | UPLC glycomics | IgG glycosylation-based immune age | Blood | $299--$399 |

Sources: [98, 102, 103, 104].

A somatic-mutation-driven model of epigenetic aging, published in *Nature Aging* (2025), found that somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals (Pearson r = 0.67 for mutation clock vs. r = 0.83 for methylation clock in predicting chronological age) [105]. This raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks measure epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations---with profound implications for whether epigenetic rejuvenation therapies address root causes or symptoms.

---

### 5.5 Use as Clinical Trial Endpoints

The adoption of aging biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials is accelerating, driven by the impracticality of using lifespan or composite disease endpoints in Phase 2 trials.

**Semaglutide as Proof of Concept.** The HIV trial epigenetic aging data (PCGrimAge -3.1 years, PhenoAge -4.9 years, DunedinPACE -9%) [57] represents the most compelling demonstration to date that a pharmacological intervention can modify validated aging biomarkers in a controlled trial setting. If replicated in healthy populations, this would establish a template for biomarker-driven aging drug development.

**NR and Modest Clock Reduction.** The MCI trial finding of modest PhenoAge and GrimAge reductions with NR supplementation [42]---despite failure to improve cognition---illustrates both the sensitivity of epigenetic clocks and the uncertain relationship between biomarker improvement and clinical benefit.

**Growing Adoption.** The PEARL trial uses GrimAge and DunedinPACE as primary endpoints [27], and the TAME trial includes epigenetic age acceleration as a secondary endpoint [47]. More than a dozen ongoing longevity trials incorporate at least one epigenetic clock measure [96].

| Trial | Clock(s) Used | Role | Finding |
|-------|--------------|------|---------|
| Semaglutide HIV | GrimAge, PhenoAge, DunedinPACE | Exploratory | Significant reductions (P = 0.004--0.01) |
| NR MCI | PhenoAge, GrimAge | Secondary | Modest reductions; no cognitive benefit |
| PEARL (rapamycin) | GrimAge, DunedinPACE | Primary | Results pending |
| TAME (metformin) | GrimAge, DunedinPACE | Secondary | Results pending |
| CALERIE (caloric restriction) | DunedinPACE | Exploratory | ~2--3% pace reduction |

The critical gap remains FDA qualification of an aging biomarker as a validated surrogate endpoint. Until this occurs, longevity trials must continue to rely on composite disease endpoints or functional measures (gait speed, grip strength, SPPB) as primary outcomes, with biological aging clocks providing mechanistic support.

## 6. Industry Landscape

The longevity biotechnology sector has undergone a dramatic transformation between 2023 and 2025, transitioning from a niche investment category to a mainstream biopharmaceutical domain. This section examines the funding environment, key corporate players, emerging partnerships, and the regulatory developments that are reshaping the field.

### 6.1 Funding Trends and Investment Analysis

Global investment in longevity-focused companies reached $8.49 billion across 331 deals in 2024, representing a 220% increase from 2023 levels [30]. This surge reversed a sharp downturn experienced in 2023, signaling that investor retreat was temporary rather than structural. Q1 2024 alone accounted for $3.74 billion, driven by several mega-rounds that anchored the sector's recovery [30, 47].

The distribution of capital revealed clear investor preferences. Discovery platforms led all categories, attracting $2.65 billion (approximately 28% of total deal volume), reflecting a strategic emphasis on enabling technologies over single-asset plays [30]. Geographically, the United States continued to dominate, housing 57% of longevity companies and capturing 84% of total deal volume [30, 47]. The European Union, while trailing in absolute funding, showed notable strength in clinical-stage senolytic and diagnostics companies, with firms such as Rubedo Life Sciences (Sunnyvale/EU operations) and GlycanAge (London/Zagreb) advancing regulatory milestones [45].

A notable feature of the 2024 investment landscape was the selective concentration of capital: fewer deals were struck compared to the peak years of 2021-2022, but individual round sizes increased substantially. This pattern suggests investor maturation, with capital flowing preferentially toward companies demonstrating clinical or regulatory progress rather than speculative preclinical programs. Key transactions included the BioAge Labs IPO on NASDAQ (raising approximately $198 million) [30], a $200 million Series D for OURA (wearable health monitoring), and a $53 million Series A for Function Health (consumer diagnostics) [30].

The sector's growth trajectory can be decomposed into several thematic investment clusters: cellular reprogramming ($3 billion-plus anchored by Altos Labs), senolytic therapeutics (approximately $150 million across Unity, Rubedo, and Dorian), AI-driven discovery (approximately $500 million including Insilico Medicine and Cellarity), and consumer diagnostics (approximately $100 million across TruDiagnostic, Elysium, Tally Health, and GlycanAge) [30, 47]. The diversity of investment across 25 distinct longevity domains -- from senotherapeutics to reproductive longevity and partial cellular reprogramming -- reflects the breadth and maturation of the field [47].

### 6.2 Major Players: Profiles and Pipeline Analysis

**Altos Labs** remains the most heavily capitalized entity in longevity biotechnology, having secured $3 billion in initial funding -- the largest amount ever raised by a biotech startup [46]. Founded in 2022 with backing from Jeff Bezos and Yuri Milner, Altos operates four global research institutes (San Diego, Bay Area, Cambridge UK, and Tokyo) employing over 300 scientists, including Nobel laureates Shinya Yamanaka and Jennifer Doudna [46]. The company's core technology platform centers on Yamanaka factor-based partial reprogramming to restore youthful gene expression patterns without inducing full dedifferentiation. In August 2025, Altos initiated early human safety testing, marking a landmark transition from bench to bedside for the cellular reprogramming field [46]. Despite its unparalleled resources, the company has been criticized for relative opacity regarding specific preclinical data outputs and pipeline progression.

**Calico Life Sciences**, Alphabet's aging research subsidiary founded in 2013, takes a broad approach to understanding lifespan biology, spanning genetics, computational biology, and drug development using model organisms including naked mole rats [30]. The company's most significant external commitment is its partnership with AbbVie, valued at over $1.5 billion ($500 million each initially with $500 million options), focused on neurodegeneration and cancer [30]. After more than a decade of operation, Calico has produced notable basic research publications (including the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell atlas) but has drawn criticism for limited disclosure of aging-specific therapeutic candidates. Its clinical-stage assets, ABBV-CLS-484 (PTPN2 inhibitor) and ABBV-CLS-579 (SHP2 inhibitor), are primarily immuno-oncology programs rather than direct aging interventions.

**Retro Biosciences** has emerged as one of the most aggressive new entrants, raising a $1 billion Series A at a reported $5 billion valuation in January 2025, following an initial $180 million seed round personally funded by Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) [46]. Retro pursues three parallel approaches to extend healthy human lifespan by 10 years: partial cellular reprogramming, autophagy enhancement (via TFEB/mTORC1 modulation), and plasma-inspired therapeutics [46]. The company planned its first human trial in Australia by end of 2025. Notably, Retro's partnership with OpenAI to leverage AI for protein design and drug discovery represents a high-profile convergence of artificial intelligence and longevity biology [46].

**NewLimit**, co-founded by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong with $105 million in initial investment, focuses specifically on epigenetic reprogramming -- the targeted reversal of age-related epigenetic changes without full cellular reprogramming [46]. The company has pursued ML-guided identification of reprogramming factors and ex vivo T cell rejuvenation, leveraging manufacturing infrastructure analogous to CAR-T cell therapy. Specific pipeline candidates and clinical timelines had not been publicly disclosed as of early 2025.

**BioAge Labs** achieved a notable milestone by completing its IPO on NASDAQ (ticker: BIOA) in September 2024, becoming one of the first publicly traded pure-play longevity companies [30]. The company's genomics and biobank-driven drug discovery platform identified BGE-102 (an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor) as its lead candidate, with a Phase 1 SAD/MAD study planned for the second half of 2025 [30]. BioAge also secured a US patent for novel oral picomolar-potency APJ agonists in May 2025. However, its earlier program azelaprag (a HIF-PHI) delivered disappointing Phase 2 results in late 2024, underscoring the attrition risk inherent to aging-biology drug development.

**Cambrian Biopharma**, led by CEO James Peyer, operates a distributed development platform model, acquiring and advancing early-stage aging biology programs across multiple indications including obesity, respiratory disease, oncology, and immunology [30]. With a reported $1.79 billion valuation and $100 million Series C, Cambrian's portfolio approach provides diversification across aging mechanisms, though it introduces the complexity of managing multiple parallel programs at different stages of development.

### 6.3 Big Pharma Entry and Partnerships

The 2023-2025 period witnessed unprecedented engagement from major pharmaceutical companies with longevity-focused biotechs, signaling mainstream acceptance of aging biology as a viable drug development paradigm.

BioAge Labs secured partnerships with two top-ten pharmaceutical companies within two months: **Novartis** (December 2024) for a collaboration on aging and exercise physiology, and **Eli Lilly's ExploR&D** unit (January 2025) for metabolic aging research [30]. These deals validated BioAge's platform and reflected growing pharma interest in the aging-metabolism interface, particularly in the context of the GLP-1 agonist revolution.

The **AbbVie-Calico** partnership, now entering its second decade, represents the largest single financial commitment between a major pharmaceutical company and an aging-focused entity, with combined investment exceeding $1.5 billion [30]. AbbVie leads clinical development and commercialization of jointly discovered assets, though the pipeline has skewed toward immuno-oncology rather than aging per se.

**HanAll Biopharma** entered a deal valued at up to $300 million with Turn Biotechnologies for ophthalmology and otology applications of Turn's ERA (Epigenetic Reprogramming of Aging) mRNA platform [46]. This transaction validated the commercial potential of mRNA-delivered reprogramming factors for tissue-specific rejuvenation.

Perhaps most consequentially, **Eli Lilly** disclosed plans for a TAME-like (Targeting Aging with Metformin) clinical trial using a GLP-1 receptor agonist, motivated by accumulating evidence that GLP-1 agonists modulate multiple hallmarks of aging beyond metabolic endpoints [24]. If conducted, such a trial would represent the first direct test of a GLP-1 agonist for aging outcomes in a non-diabetic population. At the 2024 ARDD (Aging Research and Drug Discovery) conference in Copenhagen, speakers from both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly publicly engaged with the longevity research community, asking whether GLP-1s might be the first true longevity drugs [24].

Additional pharma-longevity partnerships included **Eli Lilly** deepening its collaboration with **Insilico Medicine** in 2025, and **Sanofi** maintaining a multi-target partnership with Insilico for AI-driven drug discovery [30]. These arrangements suggest that large pharmaceutical companies increasingly view aging biology not as a speculative frontier but as a tractable source of new drug targets and indications.

### 6.4 AI and Computational Approaches

Artificial intelligence has become deeply integrated into longevity drug discovery and aging measurement, with several companies demonstrating quantifiable improvements in pipeline productivity and biomarker development.

**Insilico Medicine** has assembled the most extensive AI-generated drug pipeline in the longevity-adjacent space, producing 20 preclinical candidates between 2021 and 2024 with an average turnaround of 12-18 months from target identification to preclinical candidate -- roughly 3-4 times faster than traditional timelines [30]. Notably, the company achieved a 100% success rate for IND (Investigational New Drug) submissions, with every candidate submitted to regulators being accepted [30]. Their lead program, ISM001-055 (a TRAF2/Nck kinase inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), became the first AI-discovered drug for an AI-identified target to reach Phase IIa with positive efficacy data [30]. The pipeline includes ISM8969, a brain-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor targeting neuroinflammation -- directly relevant to the inflammaging hallmark of aging -- as well as two oral GLP-1 receptor agonists nearing preclinical candidacy [30].

**Deep Longevity** (acquired by Endurance Longevity Inc.) has pioneered Deep Aging Clocks (DACs) that integrate multi-omics data -- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics -- to produce comprehensive biological age estimates [38]. Their Aging.ai platform and commercial deployment in insurance sector biological age-based underwriting represent early monetization of aging clock technology. The AgeMeter suite encompasses BloodAge, PhotoAge (facial photos), PsychAge (questionnaire-based), and MindAge (cognitive assessment), reflecting a trend toward multimodal aging assessment [38].

**Gero AI** (Singapore) developed the GeroSense platform, which uses passively collected wearable device data (step counts, activity patterns) to estimate biological age and mortality risk, outperforming previous models for these endpoints [30]. Their landmark finding -- a fundamental resilience barrier at approximately 120-150 years of human lifespan -- emerged from physics-inspired AI modeling of organism state dynamics [30]. The wearable-based approach democratizes biological age assessment by eliminating the need for blood draws or clinic visits.

**Shift Bioscience** (Cambridge, UK), founded at the Gurdon Institute, raised $16 million in seed funding in October 2024 and announced SB000 in June 2025 -- a novel single-gene target for cellular rejuvenation identified through their AI virtual cell platform [48]. SB000 reportedly achieves cellular rejuvenation at both the methylome and transcriptome levels across multiple cell types without activating pluripotency pathways, representing a fundamentally safer approach than multi-factor Yamanaka reprogramming [48]. However, the gene identity remains proprietary, and the preprint has generated scientific skepticism pending independent replication.

### 6.5 Diagnostics and Consumer-Facing Companies

The biological age testing market has matured considerably, with multiple validated technologies now commercially available at price points between $199 and $499.

**TruDiagnostic** (Lexington, Kentucky; founded 2020) has emerged as the market leader in consumer epigenetic age testing, offering the broadest panel of validated aging clocks in a single commercial test [30]. Their TruAge Complete ($499) and TruAge PACE ($229) products report DunedinPACE (the most clinically validated pace-of-aging metric), OMICmAge (a multi-omic biological age clock), and SYMPHONYAge (a composite aging metric). TruDiagnostic has become the de facto standard for epigenetic age measurement in longevity clinical trials, providing endpoint services for rapamycin, fisetin, and D+Q studies.

**Elysium Health** (New York; founded 2014), backed by 8+ Nobel laureates on its scientific advisory board, bridges diagnostics and therapeutics through its Index biological age test ($299-$499; measuring 10 areas of aging across 9 body systems) and Basis supplement (nicotinamide riboside 250 mg + pterostilbene 50 mg) [30]. The company's dual business model illustrates the convergence of measurement and intervention in the consumer longevity market.

**Tally Health** (New York; co-founded by David Sinclair of Harvard) offers TallyAge ($229), a saliva-based DNA methylation test trained on an 8,000+ person dataset [30]. The non-invasive cheek swab approach lowers the barrier to testing, though Sinclair's involvement has drawn both marketing visibility and conflict-of-interest scrutiny from the academic community.

**GlycanAge** (London/Zagreb; founded 2020) provides a distinct modality from epigenetic clocks, measuring glycosylation patterns on IgG antibodies that reflect immune system aging and chronic inflammation [30]. Backed by 200+ scientific publications, the glycan-based approach offers complementary information to methylation clocks and may be more responsive to short-term lifestyle interventions.

The consumer diagnostics segment collectively represents a market shift toward quantified self-monitoring of aging, enabling both individual health optimization and clinical trial endpoint measurement. However, standardization across clock technologies remains a challenge, with different tests occasionally yielding discordant results for the same individual [37].

### 6.6 Regulatory Developments and FDA Engagement

Several regulatory milestones between 2023 and 2025 established important precedents for the longevity therapeutic field.

The **TAME trial** (Targeting Aging with Metformin) achieved a historic regulatory outcome: the FDA agreed that aging could be treated as a clinical indication, accepting a composite endpoint of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and death as a valid primary outcome for a geroscience trial [35]. This decision, while not constituting formal approval of an aging indication, established a framework under which future longevity therapeutics could pursue regulatory pathways. The trial, now enrolling 3,000 non-diabetic adults aged 65-79 under the ARPA-H framework, is expected to complete by 2027-2028 [35].

**Loyal**, the veterinary longevity company, achieved two regulatory firsts for lifespan extension therapeutics. In February 2025, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine accepted Loyal's Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness (RXE) package for LOY-002, a caloric restriction mimetic for senior dogs [30]. In January 2026, the Technical Section (TAS) was accepted, advancing the drug toward Experimental Conditional Approval (XCA) [30]. Loyal's STAY study -- enrolling over 1,000 dogs across 70 clinical sites -- constitutes the largest veterinary clinical trial in history, with the first dog dosed in December 2023 [30]. If approved, LOY-002 would become the first FDA-approved lifespan extension drug in any species, potentially establishing a regulatory template transferable to human longevity therapeutics.

**Rubedo Life Sciences** obtained FDA IND clearance for RLS-1496, a selective GPX4 modulator that induces ferroptosis selectively in senescent cells, in September 2025 for actinic keratosis [45]. An EMA-cleared trial for psoriasis, dermatitis, and skin aging began in May 2025 with first patient dosed [45]. The dual US/EU regulatory strategy and novel mechanism of action (ferroptosis-based senolysis, distinct from BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibition) represent a meaningful expansion of the senolytic clinical pipeline.

**Unity Biotechnology** published its Phase 2b ASPIRE trial results for UBX1325 (foselutoclax) in *NEJM Evidence*, demonstrating that a single intravitreal injection of this BCL-xL inhibitor produced 5.6 ETDRS letters improvement versus sham at 48 weeks in diabetic macular edema [5]. While the earlier BEHOLD Phase 2 trial had failed to meet its primary endpoint at 24 weeks [5], the positive ASPIRE data and publication in a high-impact journal provided significant clinical validation for the senolytic therapeutic hypothesis.

## 7. Clinical Trial Landscape

### 7.1 Overview of Active and Completed Trials

The longevity clinical trial landscape has expanded considerably since 2023, encompassing a diverse array of interventions, indications, and trial designs. As of early 2025, more than 30 clinical trials of senolytic and senomorphic agents had been completed or were actively recruiting [29], while a broader analysis by PolicyLab identified 133 aging-specific trials actively recruiting participants across global registries [29].

The geographic distribution of trials reflects the investment landscape: the United States hosts the majority of trials, with significant activity at the Mayo Clinic (senolytics: D+Q, fisetin), academic medical centers (rapamycin: University of Adelaide, AgelessRx), and industry sponsors (NMN: Metro International Biotech; urolithin A: Amazentis) [29]. European contributions include the POLYCAD spermidine trial (Medical University of Graz) [39], Rubedo's EMA-cleared senolytic trial (May 2025) [45], and the Odense University Hospital D+Q osteoporosis trial [29]. Australia serves as an increasingly important jurisdiction for first-in-human longevity trials, with Retro Biosciences planning its inaugural human study there [46].

Trial phase distribution reveals a field still weighted toward early-stage investigation: the majority of completed trials are Phase 1 or Phase 2 safety/dose-finding studies, with only two large-scale Phase 3 trials in the longevity space -- TAME (metformin, enrolling) and PROTECTOR (RTB101, failed) [35]. The semaglutide SELECT and STEP-HFpEF trials, while not designed as longevity studies, have generated some of the most compelling clinical data relevant to aging endpoints [7].

### 7.2 Key Results from 2023-2025

**PEARL Trial (Rapamycin).** The Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity trial was the first long-duration randomized controlled trial of rapamycin in healthy aging adults [4]. The 48-week study enrolled 114 participants aged 50-85 who received placebo, 5 mg, or 10 mg compounded rapamycin weekly. Low-dose, intermittent rapamycin was confirmed to be relatively safe, with adverse events similar across groups. The study detected dose-dependent and sex-specific effects: women on 10 mg weekly showed improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain, while men showed improved bone mineral content. The 5 mg group reported improved general health self-assessments [4]. A critical caveat was that the compounded rapamycin formulation had approximately one-third the bioavailability of commercial formulations, complicating dose-response interpretation. While the safety data are reassuring, the modest and variable efficacy signals indicate that larger, longer trials with pharmaceutical-grade formulations will be needed to establish rapamycin's geroprotective potential in humans.

**ASPIRE Trial (UBX1325/Foselutoclax).** Unity Biotechnology's Phase 2b ASPIRE trial demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325, a BCL-xL inhibitor targeting retinal senescent cells, produced 5.6 additional ETDRS letters versus sham at 48 weeks in patients with diabetic macular edema (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7) [5]. The 48-week durability from a single injection was notable, as standard-of-care anti-VEGF therapies require monthly or bimonthly injections. UBX1325 was non-inferior to aflibercept at most time points through 36 weeks and outperformed aflibercept in patients with central subfield thickness below 400 microns [5]. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation. These results represent the most advanced clinical proof-of-concept for senolytic therapy to date.

**MitoImmune Study (Urolithin A).** Published in *Nature Aging* in 2025, this randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that urolithin A (Mitopure) at 1000 mg/day for just 4 weeks expanded peripheral naive-like CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 percentage points; P=0.0437), increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 percentage points; P=0.0061), and reduced inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) in 50 healthy middle-aged adults [6]. These findings constitute the first clinical evidence that a mitophagy activator can reverse immunosenescence markers in humans within 28 days, opening a new therapeutic axis for age-related immune decline.

**Semaglutide and Epigenetic Aging.** A preprint published on *medRxiv* in 2025 reported that semaglutide significantly decreased multiple epigenetic aging clocks in a 32-week trial of people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy: PCGrimAge (-3.1 years, P=0.007), GrimAge V1 (-1.4 years, P=0.02), GrimAge V2 (-2.3 years, P=0.009), PhenoAge (-4.9 years, P=0.004), and DunedinPACE (-0.09 units, approximately 9% slower pace, P=0.01) [7]. Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart. This provides the first clinical trial evidence that a GLP-1 receptor agonist modulates validated epigenetic biomarkers of aging, dramatically strengthening the case for GLP-1 agonists as potential geroprotective agents.

**GlyNAC Supplementation.** Kumar et al. (2023) published the results of a 16-week placebo-controlled RCT in 24 older adults aged 70-80, demonstrating that glycine + N-acetylcysteine (GlyNAC) supplementation corrected glutathione deficiency, reduced oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function, reduced inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha), improved insulin resistance, endothelial function, body composition, cognition, gait speed, grip strength, and exercise capacity [12]. The breadth of simultaneous improvements across multiple aging hallmarks was remarkable for a simple, inexpensive nutritional intervention. Importantly, benefits reversed upon cessation of supplementation, indicating that ongoing use would be necessary [12].

**NR/NMN Clinical Results.** NAD+ precursor supplementation continued to generate mixed functional results. NMN at 250 mg/day improved muscle insulin sensitivity by approximately 25% in prediabetic postmenopausal women (Yoshino et al., *Science*) [18] and at similar doses improved walking speed and sleep quality in older adults (Kim et al., *GeroScience* 2024) [18]. However, a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs encompassing 513 participants found that while NMN reliably elevated blood NAD+, most clinically relevant glucose and lipid metabolism outcomes were not significantly different from placebo, with the authors cautioning that "an exaggeration of the benefits of NMN supplementation may exist in the field" [19]. NR similarly increased blood NAD+ and PBMC mitochondrial respiration in heart failure patients, but failed to improve cardiac function, exercise capacity, or clinical endpoints [10]. An NR trial in mild cognitive impairment confirmed CNS bioavailability but did not achieve significant cognitive improvement [10]. The emerging consensus is a "NAD+ paradox": precursor supplementation reliably elevates circulating NAD+ but inconsistently translates to functional clinical benefits [19].

### 7.3 Trial Design Challenges in Aging Research

The design of clinical trials for aging interventions presents unique methodological challenges that have constrained the field's translational progress.

**Composite versus single-disease endpoints.** The TAME trial's composite endpoint (cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, or death) reflects the geroscience hypothesis that aging is a common upstream driver of multiple chronic diseases [35]. While scientifically sound, this design requires large sample sizes (n=3,000 for TAME) and extended follow-up periods (estimated completion 2027-2028) to accumulate sufficient events [35]. The regulatory acceptance of this composite endpoint was a breakthrough, but the practical burden of such trials limits their scalability.

**Long follow-up periods.** Aging outcomes by definition develop over years to decades, creating a tension between the need for clinically meaningful endpoints and the practical constraints of trial duration and funding. The Dog Aging Project's TRIAD trial (rapamycin in 580 companion dogs) has a 3-year treatment period with estimated completion in 2027-2029 [30], illustrating how even veterinary longevity trials require multi-year commitments.

**Biological age as a surrogate endpoint.** There is growing momentum toward adopting epigenetic clocks -- particularly DunedinPACE and GrimAge -- as primary or co-primary endpoints in aging trials [37, 38]. The semaglutide epigenetic aging data [7] and the PEARL trial's inclusion of epigenetic age as a secondary endpoint [4] exemplify this trend. However, surrogate endpoint validation requires demonstrating that changes in the biomarker reliably predict changes in clinical outcomes, a threshold that no epigenetic clock has yet formally met in a regulatory context [37].

**Recruitment of "healthy aging" populations.** Trials testing geroprotective interventions in ostensibly healthy older adults face recruitment challenges distinct from disease-focused trials: participants may lack disease motivation, dropout rates may be higher, and placebo effects in self-reported outcomes can be substantial. The PEARL trial's use of a compounded rapamycin formulation (with reduced bioavailability) illustrates the supply-chain challenges of testing repurposed drugs in non-standard populations [4].

### 7.4 Emerging Endpoints and Surrogate Markers

The development of validated surrogate markers for biological aging is arguably the single greatest enabler for scaling longevity clinical trials.

**Epigenetic clocks** have achieved the most advanced level of clinical validation. DunedinPACE, a third-generation pace-of-aging clock, measures the rate of biological aging rather than a static age estimate, and has been validated against mortality, morbidity, and functional decline in multiple independent cohorts [37]. GrimAge (versions 1 and 2) integrates DNA methylation surrogates for plasma proteins and smoking pack-years, predicting time-to-death with greater accuracy than first-generation Horvath or Hannum clocks [37]. Approximately 28% of the human genome encompasses age-related methylation sites, providing a rich substrate for clock development [37]. AI-powered deep aging clocks that capture non-linear interactions are beginning to outperform linear regression-based models, with multi-modal integration (epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, medical imaging) representing the current frontier [38].

**SASP factor panels** -- measuring circulating senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteins including IL-6, MMP-3, MMP-9, PAI-1, and p16INK4a -- have been adopted as secondary endpoints in most senolytic clinical trials [29]. The STAMINA pilot demonstrated correlation between TNF-alpha reduction and cognitive improvement following D+Q treatment, providing initial evidence that SASP modulation tracks with functional outcomes [16].

**Circulating NAD+ levels** serve as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for NAD+ precursor trials, with MIB-626 demonstrating a two-fold increase in blood NAD+ at 1000 mg/day [18]. However, the disconnect between NAD+ elevation and functional outcomes has tempered enthusiasm for NAD+ as a standalone surrogate for aging [19].

**Frailty indices** -- including the Fried Frailty Phenotype and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) -- remain clinically intuitive endpoints with established prognostic validity. Composite frailty assessments combining gait speed, grip strength, and self-reported function are increasingly used as co-primary endpoints in senolytic trials [29].

### 7.5 Notable Failures and Lessons Learned

The longevity field's clinical failures have been as instructive as its successes, providing critical lessons for trial design and target selection.

**RTB101 PROTECTOR Trial.** The Phase 3 PROTECTOR trial of RTB101 (a catalytic mTORC1 inhibitor developed by resTORbio) in 652 elderly adults failed to reduce laboratory-confirmed respiratory tract infections versus placebo [15]. This failure was particularly impactful because Phase 2b data had shown a 30.6% reduction in respiratory infections when RTB101 was combined with low-dose everolimus [20]. The monotherapy failure suggested that the combination's efficacy may have derived primarily from everolimus rather than RTB101, and that catalytic mTOR inhibition alone was insufficient for immune enhancement. resTORbio's stock dropped approximately 75%, and the company was subsequently acquired. The investigators (Joan Mannick and Lloyd Schor) went on to co-found Tornado Therapeutics in 2022 for refined mTOR strategies [15]. The PROTECTOR failure underscored the risk of extrapolating combination therapy results to monotherapy, and the difficulty of translating mTOR biology into simple clinical applications.

**BEHOLD Phase 2 (UBX1325 for DME).** Unity Biotechnology's BEHOLD trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant best-corrected visual acuity improvement versus sham at 24 weeks [5]. However, the subsequent ASPIRE Phase 2b trial achieved the 5.6-letter improvement at 48 weeks, suggesting that the BEHOLD failure may have reflected an inadequate follow-up period rather than drug inefficacy. This sequence illustrates a design lesson specific to senolytic therapy: because senescent cell clearance initiates a biological cascade that takes weeks to months to manifest as functional improvement, trial endpoints assessed too early may miss genuine therapeutic effects [5].

**NMN/NR Mixed Functional Results.** As discussed in Section 7.2, the consistent pattern of NAD+ elevation without proportional functional benefit across multiple NMN and NR trials suggests that age-related NAD+ decline may be a consequence rather than a cause of cellular dysfunction, or that supplementation does not adequately reach the intracellular compartments where NAD+ is most needed [19]. A 2024 meta-analysis of 12 NMN RCTs found minimal benefits for sarcopenia and muscle function in adults over 60, with several studies flagged for high risk of bias [19]. The CD38 inhibitor hypothesis -- that blocking the primary NADase responsible for age-related NAD+ degradation may be more effective than supplementing precursors -- remains to be tested clinically [19].

**Metformin and Exercise Blunting.** While not a trial failure per se, accumulating evidence that metformin may attenuate exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations in older adults has complicated the TAME trial's interpretation framework [35]. A 2025 critical review in *Ageing Research Reviews* characterized "emerging uncertainty on the anti-aging potential of metformin" in non-diabetic populations, noting methodological limitations in early influential observational studies (including the widely cited Bannister 2014 finding that diabetics on metformin outlived non-diabetic controls) [35]. The TAME trial results, expected by 2027-2028, will be essential to resolve this uncertainty [35].

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 Most Promising Near-Term Opportunities

Several intervention categories have converged on sufficient preclinical evidence, clinical proof-of-concept, and regulatory pathway clarity to warrant designation as near-term therapeutic opportunities.

**Senolytics** represent the most clinically advanced longevity intervention class. UBX1325's ASPIRE data (5.6 letters improvement, 48-week durability, *NEJM Evidence* publication) [5], Rubedo's dual FDA/EMA IND clearance for RLS-1496 [45], and the expanding pipeline of D+Q trials across Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, frailty, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis collectively indicate that senolytic therapy is approaching a clinical inflection point [29]. The emergence of next-generation approaches -- including senolytic CAR T cells providing prophylactic protection for over one year from a single low dose [28] and senoblockers that prevent senescence rather than clearing it [29] -- suggests a deepening therapeutic toolkit.

**GLP-1 receptor agonists**, while not designed as longevity drugs, have generated the most extensive real-world evidence base relevant to aging. The SELECT trial's 20% MACE reduction and 19% all-cause mortality reduction in 17,604 non-diabetic adults [7], combined with the semaglutide epigenetic clock data showing up to 4.9-year reductions in PhenoAge [7], and the ongoing EVOKE/EVOKE+ Phase 3 trial for early Alzheimer's disease (n=3,700) [7], collectively position GLP-1 agonists as potential first-generation geroprotective agents. The question of whether Eli Lilly will proceed with a TAME-like healthy aging trial using a GLP-1 agonist could define the trajectory of the field [24].

**Mitophagy activators**, particularly urolithin A, have built one of the most robust clinical evidence bases for any supplement-grade aging intervention, with 25+ registered human trials, $50 million in R&D investment, publication in *Nature Aging* (MitoImmune immune rejuvenation data) [6], and the large-scale CLARITY trial (n=650, brain health endpoints, results expected March 2026) [6]. The commercial availability of Mitopure makes this intervention immediately accessible while pharmaceutical-grade development continues.

### 8.2 Translational Gaps and Challenges

Despite accelerating progress, significant translational gaps persist. The most dramatic preclinical results -- 109% remaining lifespan extension via AAV-OSK partial reprogramming in mice [3], 30% lifespan extension via SIRT6 overexpression [25], and 41.4% extension via MCMV-TERT gene therapy [26] -- involve genetic interventions that face formidable delivery, safety, and manufacturing challenges before human translation. The gap between preclinical lifespan extension magnitudes and the modest effects observed in human trials (e.g., PEARL's sex-specific lean tissue improvements [4]; GlyNAC's broad but small-sample benefits [12]) underscores the difficulty of recapitulating mouse aging biology in human physiology.

Bioavailability remains a critical bottleneck for several promising natural compounds. Fisetin, the most potent senolytic flavonoid identified in cell-based screening, undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism with low aqueous solubility, limiting its systemic bioavailability [13]. Similarly, spermidine's cognitive effects have been inconsistent across trials, potentially reflecting variable gut absorption and bioavailability [20]. Novel delivery systems -- including liposomal formulations, lipid nanoparticles, and prodrug strategies -- are being developed to address these limitations but add complexity and cost.

Target validation also remains incomplete for several intervention classes. The finding that somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks are measuring epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations [41]. If the latter, then epigenetic rejuvenation therapies may address symptoms rather than root causes of aging, with implications for the durability and depth of therapeutic effects.

### 8.3 Safety and Ethical Considerations

Long-term safety remains the primary concern for chronic geroprotective interventions. Rapamycin, despite the most robust preclinical lifespan extension data of any pharmacological agent (9-26% in mice) [4, 15], carries immunosuppressive risks at standard doses that must be carefully distinguished from the immune-enhancing effects observed at low intermittent doses [4, 20]. The PEARL trial's confirmation of safety at 5-10 mg weekly in healthy adults [4] is encouraging but insufficient to characterize risk over the decades-long exposure that would be required for a true geroprotective agent.

Cellular reprogramming therapies raise the specter of tumorigenesis. The Yamanaka factor c-Myc is a known oncogene, leading most groups to use OSK (omitting c-Myc), but even OSK carries risk if expression is not precisely controlled [3]. The identification of single-gene targets such as SB000 that bypass pluripotency pathways represents a safety advancement [48], though extensive in vivo validation will be required.

Ethical considerations also attend the growing consumer diagnostics market. Biological age tests marketed directly to consumers may generate anxiety without actionable clinical guidance, particularly when different clock technologies yield discordant results [37]. The commercialization of aging interventions -- particularly supplements marketed with anti-aging claims based on preclinical data -- raises concerns about premature consumer adoption ahead of clinical evidence [19].

### 8.4 The Healthspan vs. Lifespan Debate

A conceptual tension persists within the longevity field between maximizing lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health). Most clinical trials, regulatory discussions, and public communication have converged on healthspan as the more tractable and ethically defensible goal. The TAME trial's composite endpoint (delay of age-related disease onset rather than extension of maximum lifespan) [35], Loyal's focus on quality of life in senior dogs [30], and the emphasis on functional outcomes (gait speed, muscle strength, cognition) in senolytic trials [29] all reflect this framing.

However, the distinction is partly artificial. Preclinical interventions that extend lifespan typically do so by compressing morbidity rather than extending the period of decline. Rapamycin-treated mice do not merely live longer; they maintain youthful phenotypes longer and then decline relatively rapidly [4, 15]. Partial reprogramming extends remaining lifespan by 109% in mice while simultaneously improving health metrics [3]. The SIRT6 overexpression model explicitly preserves "vigorous physical activity equivalent to young mice into old age" alongside the 30% lifespan extension [25].

The practical convergence of healthspan and lifespan goals suggests that the distinction is most useful as a communication strategy rather than a scientific dichotomy. Interventions that delay the onset of age-related dysfunction will inherently extend both healthy and total lifespan.

### 8.5 Convergence of AI and Longevity Science

The integration of artificial intelligence into longevity research has progressed beyond computational convenience to become a defining feature of the field's trajectory. This convergence operates at three levels.

First, **AI-driven drug discovery** has compressed timelines for target identification and compound optimization. Insilico Medicine's 12-18 month target-to-preclinical-candidate cycle (versus 4-6 years conventionally) and 100% IND success rate demonstrate quantifiable gains in pipeline productivity [30]. The Retro Biosciences-OpenAI partnership for AI-designed proteins that temporarily convert regular cells into stem cells represents a frontier integration of generative AI and reprogramming biology [46].

Second, **AI-powered biological age assessment** has advanced from simple regression models to deep learning systems capable of integrating multimodal data [38]. The transition from Horvath's first-generation clock (2013) to DunedinPACE (third-generation, pace-of-aging) and now to deep aging clocks integrating imaging, proteomics, and behavioral data reflects an accelerating sophistication that will improve endpoint measurement for clinical trials [37, 38].

Third, **computational modeling of aging** -- exemplified by Shift Bioscience's AI virtual cell platform [48] and Gero AI's physics-inspired organism state models [30] -- is beginning to generate testable hypotheses about minimal interventions needed for rejuvenation. These platforms may enable the identification of single-gene or low-complexity interventions that achieve disproportionate rejuvenation effects.

## 9. Future Directions

### 9.1 Predicted Breakthroughs 2025-2028

The 2025-2028 window is likely to yield several landmark results that will define the field's next decade. The TAME trial completion (estimated 2027-2028) will provide the first definitive data on whether metformin delays composite age-related disease in non-diabetic adults [35]. Results from the CLARITY trial (n=650, urolithin A for brain health, March 2026) will establish whether mitophagy activation produces neurological benefits at scale [6]. The EVOKE/EVOKE+ trials (n=3,700, oral semaglutide for early Alzheimer's, estimated 2025-2026) will determine whether GLP-1 agonism modifies neurodegenerative disease trajectory [7]. The Dog Aging Project's TRIAD trial (n=580, rapamycin in companion dogs, estimated 2027-2029) will provide the first lifespan-as-primary-endpoint data for a pharmacological intervention in a mammalian species [30].

On the regulatory front, Loyal's LOY-002 may achieve FDA conditional approval as the first lifespan extension drug in any species [30]. Altos Labs' ongoing human safety testing of reprogramming-based therapies, combined with Retro Biosciences' planned Australian human trial, will provide the first human safety data for partial reprogramming approaches [46]. Rubedo's Phase 1b/2a data for RLS-1496 will expand the clinical evidence base for novel senolytic mechanisms [45].

### 9.2 Technologies to Watch

**Senolytic immunotherapies** -- including uPAR-targeting CAR T cells [28] and senolytic vaccines -- represent a paradigm shift from repeated small-molecule dosing to one-and-done living drug approaches. If the prophylactic efficacy demonstrated in mice (>1 year from a single low dose) [28] translates to humans, senolytic CAR T cells could provide durable senescent cell surveillance that small molecules cannot match.

**Chemical reprogramming** -- the replacement of transcription factor-based Yamanaka cocktails with small-molecule combinations that achieve equivalent epigenetic rejuvenation -- could dramatically simplify delivery and improve safety profiles for reprogramming therapies. Early-stage work in this direction has been reported from multiple laboratories, including efforts at Altos Labs.

**cGAS-STING pathway inhibitors** have emerged as high-priority targets for inflammaging following the demonstration that STING blockade improves memory and physical function in aged mice [8] and the discovery that aging activates a noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway distinct from canonical activation [9]. Multiple pharmaceutical companies are developing STING inhibitors for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, creating potential repurposing opportunities for aging indications.

**Microbiome-based therapeutics**, including targeted probiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, address the dysbiosis hallmark of aging through modulation of short-chain fatty acid production, epithelial barrier integrity, and systemic inflammation [32]. The addition of dysbiosis as a hallmark in the 2023 Lopez-Otin update has focused investment and research attention on this underexplored therapeutic axis [1].

### 9.3 Key Unanswered Questions

Several fundamental questions will shape the field's trajectory:

1. **Are epigenetic clocks measuring causes or consequences of aging?** The finding that somatic mutations drive cascading epigenetic changes [41] raises the question of whether epigenetic rejuvenation addresses root causes or symptoms. Resolution of this question has profound implications for the entire reprogramming therapeutic paradigm.

2. **Can partial reprogramming be made safe enough for chronic human use?** The 109% remaining lifespan extension in mice [3] is extraordinary, but tumor risk from even transient Yamanaka factor expression remains the central safety concern. Single-gene approaches like SB000 [48] and chemical reprogramming may provide paths forward.

3. **Do GLP-1 agonists have true geroprotective effects independent of metabolic improvement?** The epigenetic clock data [7] and multi-organ benefit profile are suggestive, but most evidence comes from metabolically unhealthy cohorts. A TAME-like trial in healthy populations would be definitive [24].

4. **What is the optimal combination of geroprotective interventions?** The multi-hallmark nature of aging [1] suggests that no single intervention will be sufficient. Whether rational polytherapy (e.g., a senolytic + autophagy activator + NAD+ modulator) produces synergistic benefits is largely untested in humans.

5. **Can biological age reversal be sustained?** GlyNAC benefits reversed upon cessation [12]. Whether other interventions produce durable rejuvenation or require chronic administration will determine the practical feasibility and cost of longevity therapeutics.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The longevity research field between 2023 and 2025 has undergone a transition from speculative science to clinical medicine. The updated hallmarks of aging framework (now 12 hallmarks) [1] provides a coherent organizational schema for an increasingly diverse array of interventions, from small-molecule senolytics reaching Phase 2b [5] to gene therapy-mediated partial reprogramming extending mouse lifespan by over 100% [3]. Investment has surged to $8.49 billion in 2024 [30], major pharmaceutical companies have entered longevity-focused partnerships [24, 30], and the FDA has accepted aging as a treatable indication [35].

The clinical evidence base, while still emerging, has produced several validated proof-of-concept results: UBX1325's durable senolytic effect in diabetic macular edema [5], urolithin A's immune rejuvenation in 28 days [6], semaglutide's epigenetic clock reversal [7], and GlyNAC's multi-hallmark improvements [12]. Counterbalancing these successes, the RTB101 Phase 3 failure [15], UBX1325's initial BEHOLD failure [5], and the NAD+ precursor efficacy gap [19] demonstrate that translating aging biology into therapeutics remains fraught with the attrition and complexity inherent to all drug development.

The convergence of AI-driven drug discovery, validated biological aging biomarkers, expanding clinical trial infrastructure, and growing regulatory engagement positions the longevity field for its most consequential period of clinical data generation in 2025-2028. Whether this period delivers the breakthrough results needed to establish geroprotective medicine as a clinical reality will depend on rigorous trial design, transparent reporting of both positive and negative results, and sustained investment through the long timelines that aging research inherently demands.
