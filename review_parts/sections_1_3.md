## 1. Executive Summary

The period from 2023 to 2025 has witnessed a qualitative transformation in the science of aging, marked by the convergence of mechanistic insight, clinical translation, and unprecedented investment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the longevity science landscape during this pivotal era, synthesizing advances across all twelve hallmarks of aging, cataloguing the expanding pharmacological armamentarium, and assessing the regulatory and commercial infrastructure that will determine which interventions reach patients.

**Conceptual Advances.** The 2023 update to the hallmarks of aging framework by Lopez-Otin et al. [1], expanding from nine to twelve hallmarks with the addition of disabled macroautophagy, chronic inflammation (inflammaging), and dysbiosis, has reshaped the field's organizational schema. A landmark 2025 study demonstrating that somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in epigenetic age across individuals [2] has begun to unify the genomic instability and epigenetic alterations hallmarks under a shared causal mechanism. The identification of a noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway as a driver of organismal aging [3] has provided a druggable mechanistic link between DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation.

**Therapeutic Breakthroughs.** The most dramatic preclinical result of this period is the 109% extension of median remaining lifespan in aged wild-type mice by AAV-delivered OSK partial reprogramming [4]. In the clinic, the senolytic UBX1325 (foselutoclax) achieved a statistically significant 5.6-letter improvement in visual acuity from a single intravitreal injection at 48 weeks in the Phase 2b ASPIRE trial for diabetic macular edema [5]. The PEARL trial established 48-week safety data for low-dose rapamycin in 114 healthy adults aged 50-85, with sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass and general health [6]. Elamipretide (FORZINITY), a cardiolipin-stabilizing peptide, received FDA approval for Barth syndrome in September 2025, establishing the first approved mitochondria-targeting therapy [7]. The mitophagy inducer urolithin A demonstrated immune rejuvenation by expanding naive CD8+ T cells in a 28-day trial [8]. Perhaps most unexpectedly, GLP-1 receptor agonists have emerged as candidate geroprotective agents, with semaglutide producing epigenetic age reversals of 3.1 years (PCGrimAge) and 4.9 years (PhenoAge) in a clinical cohort [9].

**Near-Term Clinical Opportunities.** Five intervention classes stand out for their proximity to clinical impact: (i) UBX1325 for ophthalmic senolytic therapy; (ii) low-dose rapamycin for healthy aging, pending larger trials informed by PEARL; (iii) urolithin A, with over 25 registered clinical trials and GRAS status; (iv) elamipretide, with an established FDA approval providing a pathway for aging-related repurposing; and (v) GLP-1 receptor agonists, with massive existing safety databases and emerging evidence for multi-organ geroprotection.

**Investment and Industry.** Total longevity sector financing reached $8.49 billion across 331 deals in 2024, representing a 220% increase from 2023 [10]. Altos Labs ($3 billion), Calico (estimated $2.5-4 billion cumulative), and Retro Biosciences ($180 million seed, $1 billion Series A at $5 billion valuation) lead the well-funded startup cohort. The FDA's "reasonable expectation of effectiveness" determination for Loyal's LOY-001 in 2024 represented the first regulatory acknowledgment that lifespan extension can be a valid drug endpoint [11].

**Key Caution.** Despite remarkable scientific progress, a persistent translation gap remains. NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR) reliably raise blood NAD+ levels but have not consistently translated this into clinical endpoint improvements [12]. The Phase 3 PROTECTOR trial of RTB101 failed to demonstrate efficacy despite promising Phase 2b data [13]. The TAME trial continues to seek full funding ($45-70 million) after years of delays [14]. These experiences underscore that preclinical efficacy, even when robust, does not guarantee clinical success.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Historical Context: From Caloric Restriction to the Hallmarks Framework

The scientific study of aging has undergone a remarkable evolution over the past century, transitioning from descriptive phenomenology to a mechanistic discipline with therapeutic aspirations. The observation by McCay and colleagues in 1935 that caloric restriction extended lifespan in rats [15] established the first reproducible experimental intervention against aging, yet decades passed before the molecular mechanisms were elucidated. The identification of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway as a conserved longevity regulator in *C. elegans* by Kenyon et al. in 1993 [16], the discovery that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice by Harrison et al. in 2009 [17], and the characterization of cellular senescence as a druggable aging process by van Deursen and colleagues [18] collectively transformed aging from an inevitable decline into a potentially modifiable biological process.

The intellectual watershed came in 2013, when Lopez-Otin, Blasco, Partridge, Serrano, and Kroemer published "The Hallmarks of Aging" [19], a conceptual framework analogous to Hanahan and Weinberg's hallmarks of cancer. By organizing the diverse phenotypes of aging into nine interconnected hallmarks---genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication---the framework provided a shared vocabulary for a field that had been fractured across disciplines. The paper has since garnered over 1,000 citations per year and remains the single most referenced organizing schema in geroscience [20].

### 2.2 The 2023 Updated Framework: Twelve Hallmarks

In January 2023, the same authorship group published a landmark update, "Hallmarks of Aging: An Expanding Universe" [1], in *Cell*. This revision expanded the framework from nine to twelve hallmarks by elevating three processes to standalone status:

1. **Disabled macroautophagy** was separated from loss of proteostasis, reflecting the growing appreciation that autophagy decline affects far more than protein quality control, encompassing mitophagy, lipophagy, ER-phagy, and nucleophagy. Genetic inhibition of autophagy in young organisms recapitulates multiple aging features, while enhancement extends lifespan in virtually every model organism tested [1].

2. **Chronic inflammation (inflammaging)** was extracted from altered intercellular communication, acknowledging its status as both a consequence and a driver of virtually all other hallmarks. The cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a critical mechanistic hub connecting DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sterile inflammation [21].

3. **Dysbiosis** was introduced as an entirely new hallmark, recognizing the age-related disruption of host-microbiome symbiosis as a causal contributor to aging. Centenarian studies have revealed that exceptional longevity is associated with preserved microbial diversity and unique metabolite profiles [1].

Each hallmark satisfies three criteria established by the authors: (i) age-associated manifestation during normal aging; (ii) experimental aggravation of the hallmark accelerates aging; and (iii) therapeutic intervention against the hallmark decelerates, arrests, or reverses aging [1]. The updated framework has rapidly become the organizing principle for both academic research and drug development programs across the longevity field [20].

### 2.3 Shift from Lifespan to Healthspan Focus

A conceptual shift of equal importance has been the transition from lifespan extension as the primary metric to healthspan---the period of life spent free from serious chronic disease and disability---as the more clinically relevant and ethically compelling goal. This reframing has practical implications for trial design, endpoint selection, and regulatory strategy. The TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin), designed to enroll 3,000 adults aged 65-79, uses a composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, or death, rather than lifespan itself [14]. The development of second- and third-generation epigenetic clocks, particularly DunedinPACE [22], which measures the *rate* of biological aging rather than cumulative biological age, reflects this shift toward dynamic healthspan assessment (see Section 6).

### 2.4 Regulatory Landscape Evolution

The regulatory environment for aging interventions has evolved substantially during 2023-2025, though it remains a work in progress.

**The TAME Precedent.** The TAME trial achieved a critical regulatory milestone when the FDA agreed that aging could be a treatable indication, establishing a conceptual framework within which geroprotective drugs could seek approval [14]. However, the trial has faced persistent funding challenges ($45-70 million needed across 14 U.S. research centers), and its coordination has been transferred to ARPA-H (Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health). Notably, Eli Lilly is reportedly planning a TAME-like study incorporating a GLP-1 agonist rather than metformin, reflecting the field's shifting therapeutic landscape [14].

**Loyal and the Veterinary Pathway.** In 2024, Loyal received an FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine "reasonable expectation of effectiveness" (REE) determination for LOY-001, a growth hormone/IGF-1 axis modulator for lifespan extension in large-breed dogs [11]. This was the first time the FDA acknowledged lifespan extension as a valid drug endpoint in any species, setting a precedent that could inform human regulatory frameworks. LOY-002, an mTOR modulator for senior dog healthspan, is advancing in parallel.

**FDA Approvals of Aging-Relevant Therapies.** The September 2025 FDA approval of elamipretide (FORZINITY) for Barth syndrome [7] and the IND clearance of RLS-1496 (Rubedo Life Sciences) for actinic keratosis [23] represent additional inroads, where drugs targeting fundamental aging mechanisms gain initial approval for specific diseases, creating a platform for potential repurposing in broader aging indications.

### 2.5 Scope and Methodology of This Review

This review synthesizes peer-reviewed literature, clinical trial registry data (ClinicalTrials.gov), preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv), company disclosures, regulatory filings, and industry investment reports published between January 2023 and February 2025. We adopt the twelve-hallmark framework of Lopez-Otin et al. [1] as our organizing principle and assess each hallmark for (i) mechanistic advances, (ii) therapeutic targets identified, (iii) clinical translation progress, (iv) cross-hallmark interactions, and (v) open questions and controversies. Where possible, we provide specific quantitative data---lifespan extensions, effect sizes, p-values, sample sizes, and funding figures---to ground our assessments in evidence rather than speculation.

## 3. The Hallmarks of Aging: Recent Advances

### 3.1 Genomic Instability

#### Mechanistic Overview

Genomic instability---the progressive accumulation of DNA damage throughout the organismal lifespan---is the first and arguably most fundamental hallmark of aging. The somatic genome is continuously assaulted by exogenous agents (UV radiation, environmental mutagens) and endogenous threats (reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial metabolism, replication errors, spontaneous hydrolysis). The cell deploys an elaborate DNA damage response (DDR) network encompassing base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [1]. With age, the fidelity and capacity of these repair systems decline, leading to a net increase in somatic mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and copy number variations.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)---age-related somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (particularly in *DNMT3A*, *TET2*, and *ASXL1*)---confers clonal expansion advantages and is strongly associated with increased cardiovascular disease, hematologic malignancies, and all-cause mortality [24]. Beyond point mutations, large-scale structural variants, retrotransposon mobilization (particularly LINE-1 elements), and microsatellite instability all accumulate with age and contribute to cellular dysfunction.

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Somatic mutations drive epigenetic aging.** A landmark 2025 study by Koch et al. analyzed multimodal data from 9,331 individuals and demonstrated that CpG mutations coincide with methylation changes not only at the mutated site but with pervasive methylome remodeling extending 10 kilobases in each direction [2]. Somatic mutations explained over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals (Pearson r = 0.67 for mutation clock vs. r = 0.83 for methylation clock in predicting chronological age). This finding unifies two hallmarks---genomic instability and epigenetic alterations---under a shared mechanistic umbrella and raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks are measuring epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations [2].

**Supercharging DNA repair.** A comprehensive 2025 review in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* by Bujarrabal-Dueso et al. systematically catalogued novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing endogenous DNA repair pathways rather than merely preventing damage [25]. Approaches include small-molecule activators of PARP1, stimulation of NER through XPC modulators, augmentation of HR fidelity, and targeting the replication stress response. This review signals growing pharmaceutical interest in a hallmark that has been historically underserved by therapeutic development.

**SIRT6 overexpression.** Continued work from the Cohen laboratory at Bar-Ilan University has confirmed that SIRT6, an NAD+-dependent deacylase that promotes DNA double-strand break repair via both HR and NHEJ, extends lifespan by approximately 30% in both male and female transgenic mice [26]. SIRT6 also suppresses LINE-1 retrotransposon activity, linking chromatin maintenance to genome stability. The identification of GF-1002, a SIRT6 gene variant enriched in centenarians with demonstrated adipogenic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-tumoral properties, by TripleHelix Corporation provides a clinical development path [26].

**SGLT2 inhibitor genome protection.** A clinical study of the SGLT2 inhibitor henagliflozin (10 mg/day for 26 weeks) demonstrated measurable telomere elongation, suggesting unexpected genome-protective effects from a metabolic drug, likely mediated through reduction of oxidative DNA damage [27].

**Human DNA repair trials.** Harvard launched human clinical trials for direct DNA repair enhancement in 2024, marking a transition from preclinical research to translational medicine for this hallmark [25].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| SIRT6 activators / GF-1002 | Enhances DSB repair, suppresses retrotransposons | Preclinical (TripleHelix) |
| PARP1 modulators | Stimulates BER and SSB repair | Preclinical / early clinical |
| XPC pathway enhancers | Augments NER for UV and bulky adduct damage | Preclinical |
| NAD+ precursors (NR, NMN) | Fuels sirtuin-dependent repair | Multiple clinical trials |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Reduces oxidative DNA damage, telomere protection | Clinical (repurposing) |
| Gene therapy for DNA repair enzymes | Direct augmentation of repair capacity | Harvard trials (2024) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Genomic instability interfaces with multiple hallmarks through defined molecular mechanisms. Somatic mutations directly drive epigenetic drift, accounting for >50% of methylation age variation (Hallmark 3) [2]. Critically short telomeres trigger DDR activation and chromosomal instability via breakage-fusion-bridge cycles (Hallmark 2). Persistent DNA damage signals are a primary trigger for senescence entry via p53/p21 and p16^INK4a pathways (Hallmark 8) [1]. Cytosolic DNA fragments from unrepaired damage activate the cGAS-STING pathway, driving sterile inflammation (Hallmark 11) [21]. Mitochondrial DNA is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to limited repair capacity and proximity to ROS sources (Hallmark 7) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can DNA repair capacity be safely enhanced in humans without increasing cancer risk from aberrant repair (e.g., error-prone NHEJ)?
2. What is the relative contribution of nuclear vs. mitochondrial DNA damage to organismal aging?
3. Does repair of DNA damage reverse epigenetic clocks, given the newly established causal link [2]?
4. Can CHIP be therapeutically targeted to reduce its cardiovascular and oncogenic consequences?
5. How do somatic mutations in non-coding regulatory regions contribute to aging phenotypes?

### 3.2 Telomere Attrition

#### Mechanistic Overview

Telomeres---repetitive nucleoprotein structures (TTAGGG repeats in vertebrates) capping chromosome ends---protect genomic integrity by preventing chromosome terminus recognition as double-strand breaks. The end-replication problem ensures that telomeres shorten with each cell division in somatic cells lacking sufficient telomerase activity. When telomeres reach a critically short length, they trigger a DNA damage response driving cells into replicative senescence or apoptosis [1]. This tumor-suppressive mechanism simultaneously limits tissue regenerative capacity over time.

Telomerase, composed of the catalytic subunit TERT and the RNA template TERC, is expressed in germ cells, stem cells, and most cancers but is epigenetically silenced in the majority of somatic cells. The shelterin complex (TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, RAP1) regulates telomere structure and telomerase access. Beyond its canonical role, TERT has been shown to function as a transcription factor with extra-telomeric roles in neurogenesis, mitochondrial function, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and inflammation suppression [28].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**TERT Activating Compound (TAC).** Gorbunova, Seluanov, and colleagues conducted a high-throughput screen of over 650,000 compounds and identified a small-molecule TAC that epigenetically de-represses the endogenous TERT gene via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade [28]. Unlike direct telomerase reconstitution, TAC works by relieving epigenetic silencing, allowing cells to re-express their own TERT gene under physiological regulation. In naturally aged mice, TAC elevated TERT levels, promoted telomere synthesis, reduced cellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silenced p16^INK4a via DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC alleviated neuroinflammation, stimulated adult neurogenesis, and preserved cognitive function without increasing cancer risk [28]. This result is particularly notable because it demonstrates that TERT reactivation can reverse age-related cognitive decline through both telomere-dependent and telomere-independent (transcription factor) functions.

**TAC preclinical cognitive outcomes.** In preclinical models equivalent to humans over age 75, six months of TAC treatment led to new neuron formation in the hippocampus and significantly improved performance on cognitive tests [28].

**TERT as transcription factor.** Expanding work has confirmed TERT's role as a transcription factor affecting pathways far beyond telomere maintenance, including regulation of neurogenesis, modulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, suppression of cellular senescence and the SASP, and anti-inflammatory gene expression programs [28].

**Pharmacological and lifestyle telomere protection.** The henagliflozin finding (see Section 3.1), demonstrating telomere elongation after SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, bridges metabolic medicine and telomere biology [27]. Continued epidemiological evidence supports Mediterranean diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction as interventions that slow telomere attrition rate.

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| TAC (TERT Activating Compound) | Epigenetic TERT de-repression via MEK/ERK/AP-1 | Preclinical (2024) |
| AAV-TERT gene therapy | Direct TERT gene delivery | Preclinical (Blasco lab: lifespan extension without cancer) |
| TA-65 (cycloastragenol) | Modest telomerase activation | Nutraceutical, limited evidence |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Indirect telomere protection via oxidative stress reduction | Clinical (repurposing) |
| Danazol | TERT upregulation in telomere biology disorders | FDA-approved (off-label) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Critically short telomeres activate the DDR and can lead to breakage-fusion-bridge cycles causing chromosomal instability (Hallmark 1). Telomere shortening is a primary trigger for replicative senescence via p53 activation (Hallmark 8). Telomere attrition in tissue-resident stem cells limits their self-renewal capacity (Hallmark 9). Telomere shortening alters the epigenetic landscape of subtelomeric regions, and TERT itself has epigenetic regulatory functions (Hallmark 3). Senescent cells with critically short telomeres secrete pro-inflammatory SASP factors (Hallmark 11) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can TAC or similar TERT de-repression compounds be safely advanced to human clinical trials without oncogenic risk?
2. How do extra-telomeric TERT functions contribute to aging independently of telomere length?
3. Is there a "Goldilocks zone" for telomere length that minimizes both aging and cancer risk?
4. Can telomere lengthening reverse cellular senescence in already-senescent cells?

### 3.3 Epigenetic Alterations

#### Mechanistic Overview

Epigenetic alterations encompass changes in DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA profiles that accumulate with age without altering the underlying DNA sequence [1]. With age, the epigenome undergoes characteristic changes: global DNA hypomethylation (especially at repetitive elements, leading to retrotransposon de-repression), focal hypermethylation at CpG islands (silencing tumor suppressors and developmental genes), loss of repressive histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) at constitutive heterochromatin, and gain of activating marks at normally silenced loci. These changes erode cellular identity, compromise tissue-specific gene expression programs, and contribute to stem cell dysfunction, cellular senescence, and susceptibility to age-related diseases [1].

DNA methylation clocks---Horvath [29], Hannum [30], GrimAge [31], PhenoAge [32], and DunedinPACE [22]---have emerged as the most accurate biomarkers of biological age, capturing the cumulative impact of multiple aging processes (see Section 6 for detailed biomarker analysis). The discovery that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC---OSKM) can reprogram differentiated cells to pluripotency sparked the revolutionary insight that epigenetic aging might be reversible. Partial reprogramming---applying these factors transiently or using a subset (OSK)---has emerged as a strategy to reset the epigenome to a younger state without erasing cellular identity [1].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**AAV-OSK partial reprogramming extends lifespan by 109%.** In a study published in *Cellular Reprogramming* in 2024 by Macip et al., an AAV-delivered doxycycline-inducible OSK system (without the oncogene MYC) was administered to 124-week-old mice (equivalent to approximately 77-year-old humans) [4]. The treatment extended median remaining lifespan by 109%, representing one of the largest lifespan extensions achieved by any intervention in aged mammals. Profound epigenetic age reversal was observed in heart and liver tissues as assessed by DNA methylation clocks. This demonstrates that epigenetic rejuvenation can be applied late in life with dramatic benefit [4].

**Mesenchymal drift reversal (Cell 2025).** Research from Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte's group, published in *Cell* in 2025, revealed a pervasive "mesenchymal drift" (MD)---upregulation of mesenchymal genes and altered stromal cell composition---across over 40 human tissues during aging [33]. Increased MD correlated with disease progression, reduced patient survival, and elevated mortality risk. Critically, Yamanaka factor-induced partial reprogramming markedly reduced MD before dedifferentiation, through a partial mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Transient one-week OSKM expression suppressed MD without activating pluripotency markers such as NANOG, establishing mesenchymal drift as a fundamental aging phenotype amenable to reprogramming [33].

**SB000 single-gene rejuvenation target (Shift Bioscience).** In a June 2025 preprint, Shift Bioscience identified SB000, a single-gene target whose modulation achieves methylome and transcriptome rejuvenation across multiple cell types comparable to multi-factor reprogramming, without activating the dangerous pluripotency pathway [34]. If validated in vivo, a single-gene approach would be transformatively simpler and safer to deliver than multi-factor cocktails. The gene identity has been kept proprietary, and the preprint has generated debate pending independent replication [34].

**Single-factor reprogramming approaches.** Multiple preprints in 2025 explored individual transcription factors or small molecules that can partially reset the epigenome, moving the field away from the complexity and risk of multi-factor delivery [34].

**Chemical reprogramming.** Small-molecule cocktails mimicking the effects of Yamanaka factors are under active development, offering the advantages of dosing control, reversibility, and conventional pharmacokinetics [35].

**ICE mouse model (Yang et al. 2023).** David Sinclair's group at Harvard published the Inducible Changes to the Epigenome (ICE) mouse model in *Cell*, demonstrating that disrupting the epigenome accelerates aging and that OSK-mediated reprogramming reverses it, supporting the "Information Theory of Aging" [36]. However, this model has attracted both significant attention and some methodological criticism.

**Major industry investment.** Altos Labs ($3 billion funding) is building the largest epigenetic reprogramming research operation globally, assembling a team including Nobel laureates Shinya Yamanaka and Jennifer Doudna, and field pioneers Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, Steve Horvath, and Manuel Serrano [37]. Retro Biosciences ($1 billion Series A, 2025) is pursuing reprogramming alongside autophagy and plasma-based approaches [37]. Turn Biotechnologies has developed the ERA (Epigenetic Reprogramming of Aging) platform using mRNA delivery of reprogramming factors [37]. Life Biosciences has announced human clinical trials expected in early 2026 for an ocular application [37]. NewLimit ($80-100 million) is combining machine learning with epigenetic reprogramming, focusing on T cell rejuvenation [37]. Shift Bioscience received $16 million in seed funding in October 2024 [34].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Partial reprogramming (OSK) via AAV | Epigenome reset, lifespan extension | Preclinical; Altos Labs safety testing Aug 2025 |
| SB000 single-gene target | Single-factor rejuvenation | Preclinical (Shift Bioscience, June 2025) |
| Chemical reprogramming cocktails | Small-molecule epigenome reset | Preclinical |
| ERA platform (mRNA delivery) | Transient reprogramming factor expression | IND-enabling (Turn Biotechnologies, TRN-001 targeting 2026) |
| HDAC inhibitors | Restore histone acetylation patterns | Approved (oncology), repurposing explored |
| Alpha-ketoglutarate | TET enzyme cofactor, demethylation support | Clinical trials (ABLE trial, Singapore, n=120) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

The interplay between genomic instability and epigenetic alterations is now quantified: somatic mutations directly drive >50% of epigenetic age variation [2]. DNA damage at epigenetic regulatory elements (enhancers, promoters) permanently alters the epigenome. Senescent cells exhibit a characteristic epigenomic signature (SAHF) and SASP gene de-repression; partial reprogramming can reverse senescence markers (Hallmark 8). Epigenetic drift erodes stem cell identity and self-renewal gene expression programs; reprogramming can rejuvenate aged stem cells (Hallmark 9). Epigenetic silencing of chaperone and autophagy genes contributes to proteostasis collapse (Hallmark 4). Reprogramming reactivates telomerase in somatic cells and can restore telomere length (Hallmark 2) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal "dose" of reprogramming---how far can the epigenome be reset without risking teratoma formation or loss of cellular identity?
2. Can epigenetic reprogramming be targeted to specific tissues or cell types in vivo?
3. Is single-factor reprogramming (e.g., SB000) as effective as multi-factor approaches across different tissues?
4. What are the long-term safety profiles of partial reprogramming---does it increase cancer risk over years?
5. How do epigenetic clocks mechanistically relate to the biological processes they measure, given the new evidence for somatic mutation as a driver [2]?
6. No reprogramming-based therapy has been approved for humans as of 2025---what are the key barriers to clinical translation?

### 3.4 Loss of Proteostasis

#### Mechanistic Overview

Proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is the integrated cellular network that maintains the proteome in its functional state, encompassing protein synthesis (ribosomal quality control), folding (chaperone systems including HSP70, HSP90, and co-chaperones), conformational maintenance, and degradation (ubiquitin-proteasome system, chaperone-mediated autophagy, macroautophagy) [1]. With age, every arm of this network deteriorates: chaperone expression declines, proteasome activity decreases, autophagy flux slows, and the burden of damaged and misfolded proteins increases.

Age-dependent protein aggregation underlies the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid-beta, tau), Parkinson's disease (alpha-synuclein), Huntington's disease (polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin), and ALS (SOD1, TDP-43, FUS). Transcription factor EB (TFEB) has emerged as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression, and its nuclear translocation is impaired with age [38].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**AA-20: mTORC1-independent autophagy enhancer.** Tammineni et al. reported in *PNAS* (2025) the discovery of AA-20, a novel small-molecule autophagy enhancer that promotes cellular cleanup through a TFEB/HLH-30-dependent mechanism without inhibiting mTORC1 [38]. This mechanistic distinction from rapamycin is critical: most known autophagy inducers work by inhibiting mTOR, which has broad effects on cell growth and immune function. AA-20 specifically activates TFEB nuclear translocation, upregulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy genes. In *C. elegans*, AA-20 extended lifespan in wild-type nematodes but not in autophagy-deficient mutants, confirming mechanism specificity. AA-20 also reduced polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner [38].

**TFEB as therapeutic hub.** Overexpression studies have confirmed that TFEB activation inhibits age-related protein aggregation, enhances neuronal function, and improves muscle stem cell (satellite cell) function, positioning TFEB as a central therapeutic node for proteostasis restoration [38].

**SINE compounds for nuclear TFEB enrichment.** Inhibition of XPO1/CRM1, the exportin responsible for shuttling TFEB out of the nucleus, enriches nuclear TFEB and enhances autophagy-lysosome gene expression. SINE compounds such as selinexor (FDA-approved for multiple myeloma) represent a repurposing opportunity for proteostasis enhancement [38].

**Rapamycin confirms proteostasis benefits.** Rapamycin supplementation was confirmed to inhibit age-related protein aggregation across multiple tissues, consistent with its role as an mTOR inhibitor that de-represses autophagy. Combined with the PEARL trial safety data (see Section 3.6), this supports rapamycin as a multi-hallmark intervention [6].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| AA-20 | TFEB activation without mTORC1 inhibition | Preclinical (*PNAS* 2025) |
| SINE compounds (XPO1 inhibitors) | Nuclear TFEB enrichment | FDA-approved (selinexor, oncology); repurposing |
| Rapamycin / rapalogs | mTORC1 inhibition, autophagy induction | Clinical (PEARL trial completed) |
| HSP90 modulators | Enhanced chaperone capacity | Preclinical |
| Small-molecule chaperones (TUDCA, 4-PBA) | Chemical chaperoning of misfolded proteins | Clinical (liver disease); repurposing explored |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Proteostasis and autophagy are deeply intertwined---autophagy is the primary clearance mechanism for aggregated proteins; AA-20 bridges both Hallmarks 4 and 5. Hyperactive mTOR (Hallmark 6) increases protein synthesis rates, overwhelming chaperone capacity while suppressing autophagic clearance. Mitochondrial protein quality control (mitophagy, UPR^mt) is a specialized arm of proteostasis whose failure leads to damaged mitochondrial accumulation (Hallmark 7). Senescent cells exhibit impaired proteostasis (Hallmark 8). Epigenetic silencing of chaperone genes contributes to proteostasis decline (Hallmark 3) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can TFEB activation be achieved safely in humans without disrupting lysosomal function?
2. Can proteostasis restoration reverse existing protein aggregates (e.g., amyloid plaques) or only prevent new aggregation?
3. How does tissue-specific proteostasis differ, and do different organs require different therapeutic strategies?

### 3.5 Disabled Macroautophagy

#### Mechanistic Overview

Macroautophagy (hereafter "autophagy") was elevated to a standalone hallmark in the 2023 framework update [1], separated from loss of proteostasis. This promotion reflects the growing recognition that autophagy decline with age affects far more than protein quality control---it impairs mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy), lipid droplet catabolism (lipophagy), ER homeostasis (ER-phagy), nuclear envelope maintenance (nucleophagy), and pathogen clearance (xenophagy) [1].

The age-associated decline in autophagy enables accumulation of damaged organelles and is causally linked to aging: genetic inhibition of autophagy in young organisms recapitulates multiple aging features, while genetic or pharmacological enhancement extends lifespan in virtually every model organism tested [1]. Key regulators include the ATG family of proteins, the ULK1 initiation complex, the Beclin-1/VPS34 nucleation complex, and the LC3 conjugation machinery. TFEB and TFE3 are master transcriptional activators of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, and their nuclear exclusion by mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation represents a critical control point [38].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**AA-20 (PNAS 2025).** As detailed in Section 3.4, AA-20 activates autophagy through TFEB/HLH-30 without inhibiting mTORC1, extending *C. elegans* lifespan and representing a mechanistically distinct approach from rapamycin [38].

**Autophagy modulators for Alzheimer's disease.** A 2024 review in *Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience* catalogued autophagy-targeting compounds advancing toward clinical use in Alzheimer's disease, including trehalose, spermidine, and lithium, with several in early-phase clinical trials [39].

**Retro Biosciences autophagy platform.** Retro Biosciences (backed by $1 billion Series A) is pursuing autophagy enhancement as one of three pillars of its longevity platform (alongside partial reprogramming and plasma-based therapies), bringing substantial resources to the field [37].

**Spermidine and trehalose clinical evidence.** Continued clinical and epidemiological data support spermidine (an autophagy inducer via eIF5A hypusination and EP300 acetyltransferase inhibition) in promoting healthy aging. The POLYCAD trial randomized 187 elderly patients with coronary artery disease to 24 mg/day spermidine or placebo, with recruitment completed in August 2025 and co-primary endpoints including left ventricular mass, peak VO2, lean mass, and hsCRP [40]. Earlier cognitive studies have shown mixed results: the SmartAge trial of approximately 100 older adults with subjective cognitive decline showed trends toward improved memory with spermidine supplementation (approximately 1.2 mg/day from wheat germ extract for 3 months), reaching significance in some secondary endpoints [41], while a subsequent 100-participant trial over 12 months showed no benefit [40].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| AA-20 | TFEB activation (mTORC1-independent) | Preclinical (*PNAS* 2025) |
| Rapamycin / rapalogs | mTORC1 inhibition, autophagy de-repression | Clinical (PEARL trial) |
| Spermidine | Autophagy via eIF5A hypusination, EP300 inhibition | POLYCAD trial (n=187, completed recruitment) |
| Trehalose | TFEB activation | Preclinical, early clinical (Alzheimer's) |
| Lithium (low-dose) | Autophagy via IMPase inhibition (mTOR-independent) | Clinical (psychiatric use); repurposing |
| Beclin-1 peptide mimetics | Enhanced autophagosome nucleation | Preclinical |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Autophagy is the primary mechanism for clearing protein aggregates, and its decline directly worsens proteostasis failure (Hallmark 4). Mitophagy decline leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria (Hallmark 7). mTOR is the central nexus: nutrient excess activates mTORC1, which phosphorylates and inactivates TFEB and ULK1, suppressing autophagy (Hallmark 6). Autophagy-competent cells may undergo autophagic cell death rather than persisting as senescent cells (Hallmark 8). Autophagy of damaged nuclear components (nucleophagy) and cytosolic DNA helps maintain genome integrity (Hallmark 1) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Why does autophagy decline with age---is it primarily transcriptional, post-translational, or structural (lysosomal dysfunction)?
2. Can mTORC1-independent autophagy activators (e.g., AA-20) provide the lifespan benefits of rapamycin without immunosuppressive side effects?
3. Is there a risk of excessive autophagy causing tissue damage in certain contexts?

### 3.6 Deregulated Nutrient-Sensing

#### Mechanistic Overview

Nutrient-sensing pathways evolved to coordinate growth, metabolism, and stress resistance with nutrient availability. Four key axes are central: (1) the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway; (2) mTOR, integrating amino acid, energy, and growth factor signals; (3) AMPK, sensing low energy states; and (4) sirtuins, sensing NAD+ levels [1]. With age, IIS and mTOR tend toward constitutive activation, while AMPK and sirtuin activity decline, promoting anabolism over catabolism and accelerating damaged macromolecule accumulation. Caloric restriction, which has extended lifespan in every organism tested from yeast to primates, works largely by rebalancing these pathways toward the "fasted" state [1].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**PEARL Trial (rapamycin in healthy aging).** The Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity (PEARL) trial (NCT04488601) was a 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT enrolling 114 healthy adults aged 50-85, testing compounded rapamycin at 5 mg or 10 mg weekly versus placebo [6]. Key findings included: (i) safety and tolerability over 48 weeks with no serious adverse events attributable to treatment; (ii) women on 10 mg showed improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain scores; (iii) the 5 mg group showed improved emotional well-being and general health perceptions; (iv) improved bone mineral content was observed in men. An important caveat: the compounded rapamycin formulation had approximately one-third the bioavailable concentration compared to commercial (Rapamune) formulations, meaning effective doses were lower than nominal [6]. A comprehensive 2025 review in *Frontiers in Aging* by Vellai et al. concluded there is "no clear clinical evidence" that preclinical benefits have yet fully translated to humans, highlighting the need for larger and longer trials [42].

**Rapamycin + acarbose combination.** In NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP) mouse studies, the combination of rapamycin with acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) produced up to a 36.6% increase in median lifespan, one of the largest pharmacological lifespan extensions reported [17].

**Low-dose rapamycin immune enhancement.** A study of 1 mg/day rapamycin for 8 weeks in elderly subjects demonstrated enhanced immune function and reduced infections, challenging the assumption that mTOR inhibition is uniformly immunosuppressive [43]. The landmark Mannick et al. Phase 2a trial (NCT01227135) of low-dose everolimus in 218 healthy older adults had previously shown a 20% increase in influenza vaccine antibody titers and reduced PD-1 expression on T cells [44], and these findings continue to underpin the therapeutic rationale for mTOR modulation in aging.

**Oxford rapamycin-senescence study.** A study from Oxford demonstrated that low-dose rapamycin reduces senescent cell burden in older adults, providing human evidence that mTOR inhibition activates senescent cell clearance mechanisms---a senomorphic (and possibly senolytic) effect [45].

**TAME Trial update.** The Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial continues to seek full funding ($45-70 million) and has been transferred to ARPA-H coordination. Emerging data has introduced uncertainty about metformin's benefits in non-diabetic populations: some studies suggest it may blunt exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations [46]. A 2024 study in *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* showed metformin decreased protein age by an average of 6.41 years in cynomolgus monkeys over 3.3 years of treatment [47], supporting the biological rationale, while a 2025 critical review in *Ageing Research Reviews* highlighted "emerging uncertainty on the anti-aging potential of metformin" in non-diabetic humans [48]. Eli Lilly is planning a TAME-like study using a GLP-1 agonist, reflecting the field's shifting interest toward incretin-based interventions [14].

**RTB101 Phase 3 failure.** The PROTECTOR Phase 3 trial (NCT03693612) of RTB101 (a catalytic mTOR inhibitor) monotherapy in 652 elderly volunteers failed to reduce respiratory infections compared to placebo, despite promising Phase 2b combination data (30.6% reduction with RTB101 + everolimus) [13]. This highlighted the challenge of translating mTOR pathway modulation to clinical endpoints.

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Rapamycin (low-dose, intermittent) | mTORC1 inhibition | PEARL (Phase 2 completed); larger trials needed |
| Rapamycin + acarbose | Dual mTOR + glucose absorption inhibition | Preclinical (ITP: 36.6% lifespan extension) |
| Everolimus (low-dose) | mTORC1 inhibition, immune rejuvenation | Phase 2 completed; EVERLAST ongoing |
| Metformin | AMPK activation, complex I inhibition | TAME trial (Phase 3, funding in progress) |
| Acarbose | Alpha-glucosidase inhibition | ITP data; available as generic |
| Canagliflozin (SGLT2i) | Glucose handling, possible AMPK activation | ITP data (lifespan extension in males) |
| NAD+ precursors (NR, NMN) | Sirtuin activation via NAD+ repletion | Multiple clinical trials (see Section 3.7) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

mTOR is the master switch: its inhibition directly activates autophagy via TFEB and ULK1 de-repression (Hallmark 5). Hyperactive mTOR increases protein synthesis rates while suppressing autophagic clearance, overwhelming proteostasis (Hallmark 4). AMPK activation promotes mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis; its decline with age impairs mitochondrial quality control (Hallmark 7). mTOR signaling in senescent cells drives the SASP; rapamycin suppresses SASP secretion (senomorphic effect; Hallmark 8). Nutrient-sensing pathways regulate NF-kappaB-driven inflammation (Hallmark 11) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal rapamycin dosing regimen for healthy aging in humans?
2. Does the PEARL trial's compounded formulation issue (one-third bioavailability) mean the true effective dose was significantly lower than intended?
3. Can rapamycin + acarbose be safely translated to humans?
4. What is the role of GLP-1 agonists as nutrient-sensing modulators in aging (see Section 3.11)?

### 3.7 Mitochondrial Dysfunction

#### Mechanistic Overview

Mitochondria serve as primary generators of cellular ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and as signaling hubs for apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, innate immunity (via mtDNA sensing), and metabolite production. With age, mtDNA mutations accumulate, OXPHOS complex activity declines, ROS production rises, mitochondrial dynamics shift toward fragmentation, and mitophagy becomes impaired [1]. Cardiolipin, a phospholipid unique to the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for cristae structure and OXPHOS supercomplex assembly, undergoes oxidation with age, representing a key biophysical driver of mitochondrial decline [49].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Urolithin A (Mitopure): extensive clinical program.** Timeline/Amazentis has built the most comprehensive clinical program for any mitophagy enhancer, with over 25 registered human trials representing more than $50 million in R&D investment and 80+ global patents [50]. Key results include:

- *Muscle health:* A randomized controlled trial demonstrated a 12% improvement in hamstring muscle strength after 4 months of supplementation at 500 mg or 1000 mg daily (P = 0.027 and P = 0.029 vs. placebo, respectively), with improved aerobic endurance and reduced plasma acylcarnitines and CRP [50].
- *MitoImmune study (Nature Aging, 2025):* In 50 healthy middle-aged adults, 1000 mg/day urolithin A for 4 weeks expanded naive-like CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 percentage points; P = 0.0437), increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 pp; P = 0.0061), and reduced inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), demonstrating immune rejuvenation through improved mitochondrial fitness [8].
- *CLARITY study:* A major trial enrolling 650 participants to assess effects on brain health and cognitive function, with completion expected in March 2026 [50].

**Elamipretide (FORZINITY): FDA approval.** Elamipretide received FDA approval in September 2025 for Barth syndrome under accelerated approval, establishing the first FDA-approved mitochondria-targeting peptide therapy [7]. Elamipretide (D-Arg-dimethylTyr-Lys-Phe-NH2) selectively binds cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, stabilizing cristae structure, maintaining OXPHOS supercomplex assembly, reducing electron leak and ROS production, and enhancing ATP generation [49]. Preclinical data demonstrate that elamipretide reverses age-related mitochondrial redox stress, improves exercise tolerance in aged animals, and restores cardiac mitochondrial function, providing a pathway for potential repurposing in age-related mitochondrial decline [49]. Clinical trials across cardiovascular (PROGRESS-HF), mitochondrial myopathy (MMPOWER-3), and ophthalmic (ReCLAIM) indications have generated additional safety and efficacy data [49].

**NAD+ precursors: clinical disappointments.** NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) declines approximately 50% between ages 40 and 60, driven by increased CD38 expression, increased PARP activity, and decreased NAMPT expression [51]. NMN and NR, the two principal NAD+ precursors, have reliably raised blood NAD+ levels across multiple trials but have not consistently translated this into clinical endpoint improvements. A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (513 participants, 250-2000 mg/day NMN) found no significant benefit on fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or lipid profiles [52]. A 2025 meta-analysis concluded NMN and NR offer "minimal benefits" for sarcopenia and muscle performance in older adults [12]. An NR trial in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increased blood NAD+ and showed modest NR-associated reduction in epigenetic age (PhenoAge and GrimAge) but did not alter cognition [53]. This "NAD+ paradox"---blood NAD+ goes up, but clinical benefits are not reliably observed---raises fundamental questions about the NAD+ depletion theory of aging.

Notable exceptions: NMN (250 mg/day, 10 weeks) improved muscle insulin sensitivity in prediabetic postmenopausal women as measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp [54]. NMN (250 mg/day, 12 weeks) maintained walking speed and improved sleep quality in 60 older adults [55]. CD38 inhibitors (targeting the primary NADase responsible for age-related NAD+ decline) remain at the preclinical stage but represent a conceptually upstream approach---maintaining NAD+ by preventing degradation rather than supplementing precursors [51].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Urolithin A (Mitopure) | PINK1/Parkin mitophagy induction | 25+ clinical trials; GRAS status; commercial |
| Elamipretide (SS-31) | Cardiolipin stabilization, cristae maintenance | FDA approved (Barth syndrome, Sept 2025) |
| NMN | NAD+ precursor, sirtuin activation | Multiple trials; inconsistent clinical endpoints |
| NR | NAD+ precursor | Multiple trials; NAD+ paradox noted |
| CD38 inhibitors (78c) | Prevent NAD+ degradation | Preclinical |
| CoQ10 / MitoQ | Electron transport support | Nutraceutical / clinical |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Cytosolic mtDNA from damaged mitochondria activates cGAS-STING and NLRP3 inflammasomes, driving inflammaging---a critical mechanistic link (Hallmark 11) [21]. Impaired mitophagy (Hallmark 5) is a primary cause of damaged mitochondrial accumulation. AMPK senses mitochondrial energetic output; NAD+ levels regulate sirtuins; mTOR regulates mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC-1alpha (Hallmark 6). mtDNA is highly vulnerable to oxidative damage with limited repair capacity (Hallmark 1). Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger senescence via ROS-mediated DNA damage (Hallmark 8). Stem cells rely on tightly regulated mitochondrial metabolism (Hallmark 9) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can urolithin A's clinical benefits translate to brain health (CLARITY trial)?
2. Can elamipretide be repurposed for general age-related mitochondrial dysfunction?
3. Why does raising NAD+ levels not consistently improve clinical endpoints---is the issue tissue penetrance, dosing, or a flawed underlying hypothesis?

### 3.8 Cellular Senescence

#### Mechanistic Overview

Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest accompanied by resistance to apoptosis, metabolic reprogramming, chromatin reorganization, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)---a complex mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta), chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and growth factors that collectively alter the tissue microenvironment [1]. While senescence serves beneficial roles in tumor suppression and wound healing, the accumulation of senescent cells with age drives tissue dysfunction through paracrine SASP signaling. Two primary therapeutic strategies have emerged: **senolytics** (selective killing of senescent cells) and **senomorphics** (SASP suppression), with a third approach---**senoblockers** (prevention of senescence entry)---gaining traction [56].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

Cellular senescence has become one of the most therapeutically advanced hallmarks, with over 30 clinical trials completed, underway, or planned as of 2025 [57].

**UBX1325/foselutoclax (Unity Biotechnology).** The Phase 2b ASPIRE trial in diabetic macular edema (DME) demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325, a BCL-xL inhibitor, led to a 5.6-letter improvement in ETDRS visual acuity compared to sham at week 48 (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7) [5]. The 48-week durability from a single injection is remarkable and demonstrates that localized senolytic therapy can have lasting tissue-level effects. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation, and no systemic thrombocytopenia was observed (confirming local delivery avoids systemic BCL-xL inhibition) [5]. Results were published in *NEJM Evidence*, and Unity secured $55 million in Series C funding led by Foresite Capital in 2024.

**Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q).** The STAMINA study, a 12-week pilot in 12 adults aged 65+ with MCI and slow gait, demonstrated safety, and TNF-alpha reduction correlated with improvements in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (2.0-point increase, 95% CI: 0.1-4.0, in those with lowest baseline scores) [58]. A Phase 2 osteoporosis trial reported results in 2024. The SToMP-AD Phase 2 trial at Wake Forest University is actively testing intermittent D+Q in early-stage Alzheimer's disease [59]. A pilot protocol for testing D+Q in age-related mental health conditions was accepted in February 2025 [59].

**Fisetin.** In a Mayo Clinic study of 536 long-COVID patients, 64% of the 44 receiving fisetin reported significant symptom alleviation, representing one of the largest senolytic interventional datasets [60]. A 2025 mouse study demonstrated that fisetin improved frailty indices and grip strength comparable to genetic clearance of p16^INK4a-positive senescent cells, pharmacologically validating fisetin as equivalent to genetic senescent cell elimination [60]. The Phase II TROFFi trial in frail breast cancer survivors is ongoing, the STOP-Sepsis trial tested fisetin in 220 elderly patients with sepsis (recruitment completed 2025), and NCT06431932 is characterizing fisetin's senolytic pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers [60].

**Navitoclax (ABT-263): topical delivery.** Topical navitoclax application on aged mouse skin (December 2024) demonstrated localized senescent cell clearance with skin rejuvenation effects, offering a delivery route that avoids systemic thrombocytopenia, navitoclax's primary dose-limiting toxicity due to BCL-xL inhibition in platelets [61].

**Senolytic CAR T cells.** Amor et al. (2024) demonstrated in *Nature Aging* that CAR T cells targeting uPAR on senescent cells provided prophylactic and long-lasting efficacy against age-related metabolic dysfunction in mice [62]. A single low dose provided protection lasting over one year---far exceeding the durability of small-molecule senolytics---representing a "one-and-done" senolytic approach.

**Rubedo Life Sciences RLS-1496.** The FDA cleared the IND application for RLS-1496, a first-in-class selective GPX4 modulator targeting pathological senescent cells via ferroptosis, for a Phase 1b/2a study in actinic keratosis (September 2025). An EMA-cleared trial for plaque psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and skin aging began in May 2025 [23]. This represents one of the first purpose-built senolytics to enter clinical development through a regulatory pathway.

**Dorian Therapeutics senoblockers.** Dorian is developing compounds that prevent cells from entering senescence while reactivating tissue regeneration in already-senescent neighboring cells, representing a paradigm shift from clearance to prevention [56].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| UBX1325 (foselutoclax) | BCL-xL inhibitor (intravitreal) | Phase 2b completed (ASPIRE; *NEJM Evidence*) |
| D+Q | Tyrosine kinase + PI3K/BCL-2 inhibition | Phase 1/2 (multiple: AD, frailty, IPF, bone) |
| Fisetin | BCL-2/BCL-xL, PI3K/Akt, NF-kappaB | Phase 2 (long-COVID, frailty, sepsis) |
| Navitoclax (topical) | BCL-2/BCL-xL/BCL-w | Preclinical (topical delivery) |
| RLS-1496 | GPX4 modulation (ferroptosis) | IND cleared (Sept 2025) |
| Senolytic CAR T (uPAR) | Immune-mediated clearance | Preclinical (*Nature Aging* 2024) |
| Senoblockers (Dorian) | Prevent senescence entry | Preclinical |
| Rapamycin (senomorphic) | SASP suppression via mTOR inhibition | Clinical (see Section 3.6) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

DNA damage is a primary senescence trigger; persistent DDR foci maintain the senescent state (Hallmark 1). Critically short telomeres activate p53-dependent replicative senescence (Hallmark 2). The SASP is a major driver of inflammaging; senescent cell clearance reduces systemic inflammation (Hallmark 11). SASP factors impair stem cell function in a paracrine manner (Hallmark 9). Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci and SASP gene de-repression involve major epigenomic changes (Hallmark 3). Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger senescence; senescent cells exhibit altered mitochondrial metabolism sustaining the SASP (Hallmark 7) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal senolytic dosing regimen: intermittent "hit-and-run" vs. continuous therapy?
2. Can senolytic CAR T cells be safely deployed in humans without autoimmunity risk?
3. How do we selectively target detrimental senescent cells while preserving beneficial senescence?
4. Can UBX1325 ASPIRE results be replicated in other ophthalmic diseases (AMD, glaucoma)?
5. What biomarkers best track senescent cell burden in humans for clinical trial endpoints?

### 3.9 Stem Cell Exhaustion

#### Mechanistic Overview

Tissue homeostasis and regeneration depend on resident stem and progenitor cell populations. With age, these pools decline in number, functional capacity, and regenerative output---a process termed stem cell exhaustion [1]. This manifests as impaired wound healing, immunosenescence, sarcopenia, thinning intestinal epithelium, and declining neurogenesis. Five hallmark characteristics of aged stem cells have been identified: (1) altered quiescence depth; (2) changed self-renewal (shift toward asymmetric or symmetric commitment divisions); (3) altered cell fate (lineage bias, e.g., myeloid skewing in hematopoietic stem cells); (4) compromised stress resilience; and (5) reduced population heterogeneity (clonal dominance) [63].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Senescence-resistant cells halt aging in macaques (Cell 2025).** In a landmark study, Liu et al. created genetically engineered senescence-resistant cells (SRCs) by overexpressing FOXO3 in human mesenchymal progenitor cells [64]. Biweekly intravenous SRC infusions (2 x 10^6 cells/kg) to elderly macaques over 44 weeks produced multi-system rejuvenation across 61 tissue types and 10 physiological systems. Machine-learning aging clocks estimated neuronal cells were biologically reverted by 6-7 years, oocytes by 5 years. Enhanced brain architecture, cognitive function, and reproductive function were observed. No tumors, immune overreactions, or serious adverse events occurred [64]. This is the most comprehensive primate rejuvenation study published to date.

**Rejuvenate Bio RJB-0402.** Rejuvenate Bio received $4 million from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) in July 2024 for development of RJB-0402, a gene therapy approach targeting multiple aging pathways in stem cells [65].

**Comprehensive rejuvenation framework.** A systematic framework of rejuvenation approaches for aged stem cells has been established, encompassing exercise (stem cell mobilization across tissues), caloric restriction and fasting (intestinal stem cell rejuvenation via mTOR/AMPK rebalancing), senolytic clearance of SASP-producing niche cells, autophagy restoration, epigenetic reprogramming, and circulating blood factors from heterochronic parabiosis [63].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| SRCs (FOXO3-engineered) | Replace aged cells with senescence-resistant cells | Preclinical (*Cell* 2025, macaques) |
| RJB-0402 (Rejuvenate Bio) | Multi-pathway gene therapy in stem cells | Preclinical ($4M CIRM grant, 2024) |
| Partial reprogramming (OSK) | Epigenetic rejuvenation of aged stem cells | Preclinical (see Section 3.3) |
| Senolytics (stem cell niche) | Clear senescent niche cells | Clinical (see Section 3.8) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Senescent stem cells lose regenerative capacity; SASP from senescent niche cells creates a hostile microenvironment (Hallmark 8). Telomere shortening limits stem cell replicative capacity (Hallmark 2). Epigenetic drift erodes stem cell identity genes (Hallmark 3). mTOR hyperactivation depletes stem cell pools via premature differentiation (Hallmark 6). The stem cell niche is regulated by systemic signals that change with age (Hallmark 10). Autophagy is essential for stem cell quiescence-activation cycling (Hallmark 5) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can SRC therapy be translated from macaques to humans---what are the immunological barriers?
2. Is it better to rejuvenate existing aged stem cells or replace them with engineered young cells?
3. What is the cancer risk of reactivating stem cell proliferation in aged tissues with accumulated mutations?

### 3.10 Altered Intercellular Communication

#### Mechanistic Overview

Cells do not age in isolation. Aging organisms exhibit profound changes in hormones, growth factors, cytokines, extracellular vesicles, and direct cell-cell contact signals [1]. The heterochronic parabiosis model---joining the circulatory systems of young and old mice---has been transformative: old mice sharing circulation with young mice show rejuvenation of brain, muscle, liver, and bone, while young mice exposed to old blood exhibit accelerated aging [66].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Young blood vs. dilution debate.** A vigorous scientific debate has emerged regarding the mechanism of parabiosis benefits. The traditional interpretation holds that young blood contains rejuvenating factors. The alternative hypothesis, championed by Irina and Michael Conboy (UC Berkeley), proposes that the primary benefit comes from dilution or neutralization of harmful age-elevated proteins in old blood [66]. Neutral blood exchange experiments (replacing old plasma with saline-albumin solution) have shown substantial rejuvenation, supporting the dilution hypothesis. This has profound therapeutic implications: it may be simpler and safer to remove harmful factors (via plasmapheresis) than to identify and supplement beneficial ones [66].

**Alkahest plasma fractions.** Alkahest, cofounded by Tony Wyss-Coray, is developing plasma fraction-based therapeutics, with some fractions having completed Phase 2 trials for Alzheimer's disease (GRF6019) [67].

**Elevian and GDF11.** Elevian, founded by Lee Rubin (Harvard), continues developing GDF11 supplementation, with recent findings that GDF11 attenuates age-related knee degeneration in mice [68]. However, controversy persists: some studies indicate that GDF11 hinders muscle regeneration by inhibiting satellite cell activation, while others show beneficial effects on vasculature, brain, and bone [68].

**GLP-1 agonists as systemic communication modulators.** Semaglutide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists are emerging as potent modulators of systemic intercellular signaling (see Section 3.11 for detailed discussion) [69].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Plasma dilution / neutral blood exchange | Remove age-elevated harmful factors | Preclinical / early clinical |
| Young plasma fractions (Alkahest) | Supply rejuvenating circulating factors | Phase 2 (GRF6019, Alzheimer's) |
| GDF11 (Elevian) | Declining trophic factor supplementation | Preclinical |
| GLP-1 agonists | Systemic anti-inflammatory signaling | Clinical (multiple indications) |
| Klotho protein | Anti-aging circulating factor | Preclinical |

#### Open Questions

1. Is dilution of harmful aged factors more effective than supplementation of young factors?
2. Can specific rejuvenating plasma fractions be manufactured synthetically?
3. Is GDF11 beneficial or harmful for muscle regeneration?

### 3.11 Chronic Inflammation (Inflammaging)

#### Mechanistic Overview

Chronic inflammation, or "inflammaging," was elevated to a standalone hallmark in the 2023 update [1]. Unlike acute inflammation, inflammaging is a persistent, low-grade inflammatory state characterized by elevated circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CRP), activated innate immune cells, and impaired resolution. Sources include the SASP, cytosolic DNA activating cGAS-STING, gut barrier dysfunction, adipose tissue inflammation, dysregulated trained immunity, and declining regulatory T cell function [1]. The cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a critical mechanistic hub: cGAS detects cytosolic dsDNA (from mitochondrial leakage, nuclear envelope breakdown, retrotransposon activation) and produces cGAMP, activating STING, which drives type I interferon responses and NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation [21].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**cGAS-STING as central inflammaging driver.** Gulen et al. (2023) in *Nature* demonstrated that cytosolic DNA from perturbed mitochondria in aged microglia activates cGAS, driving neuroinflammation and cognitive decline [21]. Pharmacological inhibition of STING with H-151 improved muscle strength and memory in aged mice and reduced microgliosis [21]. Faria et al. (2025) in *PNAS* identified a noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway as a direct driver of cellular and organismal aging, distinct from the classical interferon response [3]. This noncanonical pathway activates NF-kappaB through an alternative mechanism, with important implications for drug design: inhibitors targeting canonical STING activation may be insufficient for age-related conditions [3]. Novel indole-based STING inhibitors and STING degraders (PROTACs) are in development [70]. cGAS-STING has been identified as a therapeutic target in osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and intervertebral disc degeneration [70].

**GLP-1 agonists as anti-inflammaging agents.** This has been the most unexpected therapeutic development of the 2023-2025 period:

- *Epigenetic age reversal in HIV:* In a 32-week randomized trial with 84 participants with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, semaglutide produced remarkable epigenetic age reversals: PCGrimAge -3.1 years (P = 0.007), PhenoAge -4.9 years (P = 0.004), and DunedinPACE slowed by 9% (P = 0.01). Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart [9].
- *MACE reduction independent of weight loss:* The SELECT trial (NCT03574597; n = 17,604) demonstrated that semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 20% (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.90, P < 0.001) and all-cause death by 19% (HR 0.81) through mechanisms independent of weight loss [71].
- *EVOKE/EVOKE+ trials for Alzheimer's:* Phase 3 trials are underway testing semaglutide for Alzheimer's disease, based on the neuroinflammation hypothesis [69].
- *Nature Biotechnology commentary:* A 2025 perspective titled "Are GLP-1s the first longevity drugs?" highlighted the multi-system geroprotective effects, with speakers from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly engaging the longevity community at the ARDD conference in Copenhagen [69].
- *Key caveat:* No healthy-population longevity trials have been conducted. Most evidence comes from metabolically unhealthy or HIV-positive cohorts [9].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| H-151 / novel STING inhibitors | Block cGAS-STING-driven inflammation | Preclinical |
| STING degraders (PROTACs) | Selective STING degradation | Preclinical |
| Semaglutide / GLP-1 agonists | Multi-mechanism anti-inflammatory | Approved (T2D/obesity); Phase 3 (Alzheimer's) |
| Senolytics (D+Q, fisetin) | Remove SASP-producing senescent cells | Clinical (see Section 3.8) |
| Rapamycin (senomorphic) | Suppress SASP via mTOR inhibition | Clinical (see Section 3.6) |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

The SASP from senescent cells is a primary source of inflammaging (Hallmark 8). Cytosolic mtDNA from damaged mitochondria activates cGAS-STING (Hallmark 7). Nuclear DNA fragments and retrotransposon-derived DNA activate cGAS-STING (Hallmark 1). Gut barrier dysfunction increases systemic endotoxin exposure (Hallmark 12). mTOR promotes NF-kappaB-driven inflammation (Hallmark 6) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Can cGAS-STING inhibition be safely deployed long-term without compromising antiviral/antitumor immunity?
2. Are GLP-1 agonists truly geroprotective agents, or are their epigenetic clock effects limited to specific populations (HIV, obesity)?
3. What is the optimal level of inflammation for healthy aging---complete suppression may impair immune surveillance?

### 3.12 Dysbiosis

#### Mechanistic Overview

Dysbiosis---age-related disruption of host-microbiome symbiosis---was added as a new hallmark in the 2023 update [1]. The human gut microbiome collectively influences metabolism, immune function, barrier integrity, neurotransmitter production, and epigenetic regulation through metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, tryptophan metabolites). With aging, characteristic changes occur: reduced alpha-diversity, expansion of pro-inflammatory pathobionts, decline of beneficial commensals (e.g., *Bifidobacterium*, *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*), reduced SCFA production (particularly butyrate), gut barrier dysfunction ("leaky gut"), and altered bile acid metabolism [1].

Studies of centenarians and supercentenarians reveal that exceptional longevity is associated with preserved or increased microbial diversity and elevated abundance of unique secondary bile acid-producing taxa, suggesting microbiome maintenance may be both a marker and mediator of healthy aging [72].

#### Key Breakthroughs 2023-2025

**Centenarian microbiome studies.** Multiple studies (2023-2025) confirmed that long-lived individuals show increased microbial diversity and enrichment of specific taxa with antimicrobial and health-promoting properties [72].

**"Biome-aging" concept.** The bidirectional relationship between microbiome deterioration and organismal aging has been formalized as "biome-aging," with comprehensive reviews published in *Genome Medicine*, *Journal of Biomedical Science*, and *Frontiers in Aging* in 2025 [73].

**Dietary interventions.** Fiber-rich and PUFA-rich diets increase microbial diversity and SCFA production in elderly populations. Polyphenol supplementation selectively promotes beneficial taxa. Mediterranean diet adherence in elderly populations is consistently associated with preserved microbial diversity and reduced frailty [73].

**Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).** Preclinical studies demonstrated that FMT from young donors to aged recipients reverses age-related gut barrier dysfunction, reduces systemic inflammation, and improves cognitive function in aged mice [73].

**Urolithin A as microbiome-mitochondria bridge.** Urolithin A, the mitophagy inducer discussed in Section 3.7, is produced by gut bacteria from dietary ellagitannins, exemplifying how microbiome function directly impacts mitochondrial health---a cross-hallmark interaction with therapeutic relevance [50].

#### Therapeutic Targets

| Target | Mechanism | Stage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Mediterranean/high-fiber diet | Increase diversity, SCFA production | Clinical evidence (lifestyle) |
| FMT (young to aged) | Microbiome restoration | Preclinical, early clinical |
| *Akkermansia muciniphila* | Mucin-layer restoration | Clinical trials (pasteurized form) |
| Postbiotics (butyrate, propionate) | Direct metabolite delivery | Nutraceutical |
| Next-gen probiotics | Engineered strains | Preclinical / early clinical |

#### Cross-Talk with Other Hallmarks

Gut barrier dysfunction allows microbial products (LPS) to enter systemic circulation, activating TLR4 and NF-kappaB (Hallmark 11). Microbial metabolites (SCFAs, tryptophan derivatives) are systemic signaling molecules influencing distant organs (Hallmark 10). SCFAs activate AMPK, connecting to nutrient-sensing pathways (Hallmark 6). Butyrate functions as an HDAC inhibitor, directly influencing host epigenetics (Hallmark 3). Urolithin A production connects microbiome function to mitophagy (Hallmark 7) [1].

#### Open Questions

1. Is there an "optimal" microbiome composition for healthy aging, or does it vary by individual genetics and geography?
2. Can FMT safely and durably rejuvenate the aged microbiome in humans?
3. What role does the non-bacterial microbiome (fungi, viruses, archaea) play in aging?
