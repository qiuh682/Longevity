## 6. Industry Landscape

The longevity biotechnology sector has undergone a dramatic transformation between 2023 and 2025, transitioning from a niche investment category to a mainstream biopharmaceutical domain. This section examines the funding environment, key corporate players, emerging partnerships, and the regulatory developments that are reshaping the field.

### 6.1 Funding Trends and Investment Analysis

Global investment in longevity-focused companies reached $8.49 billion across 331 deals in 2024, representing a 220% increase from 2023 levels [30]. This surge reversed a sharp downturn experienced in 2023, signaling that investor retreat was temporary rather than structural. Q1 2024 alone accounted for $3.74 billion, driven by several mega-rounds that anchored the sector's recovery [30, 47].

The distribution of capital revealed clear investor preferences. Discovery platforms led all categories, attracting $2.65 billion (approximately 28% of total deal volume), reflecting a strategic emphasis on enabling technologies over single-asset plays [30]. Geographically, the United States continued to dominate, housing 57% of longevity companies and capturing 84% of total deal volume [30, 47]. The European Union, while trailing in absolute funding, showed notable strength in clinical-stage senolytic and diagnostics companies, with firms such as Rubedo Life Sciences (Sunnyvale/EU operations) and GlycanAge (London/Zagreb) advancing regulatory milestones [45].

A notable feature of the 2024 investment landscape was the selective concentration of capital: fewer deals were struck compared to the peak years of 2021-2022, but individual round sizes increased substantially. This pattern suggests investor maturation, with capital flowing preferentially toward companies demonstrating clinical or regulatory progress rather than speculative preclinical programs. Key transactions included the BioAge Labs IPO on NASDAQ (raising approximately $198 million) [30], a $200 million Series D for OURA (wearable health monitoring), and a $53 million Series A for Function Health (consumer diagnostics) [30].

The sector's growth trajectory can be decomposed into several thematic investment clusters: cellular reprogramming ($3 billion-plus anchored by Altos Labs), senolytic therapeutics (approximately $150 million across Unity, Rubedo, and Dorian), AI-driven discovery (approximately $500 million including Insilico Medicine and Cellarity), and consumer diagnostics (approximately $100 million across TruDiagnostic, Elysium, Tally Health, and GlycanAge) [30, 47]. The diversity of investment across 25 distinct longevity domains -- from senotherapeutics to reproductive longevity and partial cellular reprogramming -- reflects the breadth and maturation of the field [47].

### 6.2 Major Players: Profiles and Pipeline Analysis

**Altos Labs** remains the most heavily capitalized entity in longevity biotechnology, having secured $3 billion in initial funding -- the largest amount ever raised by a biotech startup [46]. Founded in 2022 with backing from Jeff Bezos and Yuri Milner, Altos operates four global research institutes (San Diego, Bay Area, Cambridge UK, and Tokyo) employing over 300 scientists, including Nobel laureates Shinya Yamanaka and Jennifer Doudna [46]. The company's core technology platform centers on Yamanaka factor-based partial reprogramming to restore youthful gene expression patterns without inducing full dedifferentiation. In August 2025, Altos initiated early human safety testing, marking a landmark transition from bench to bedside for the cellular reprogramming field [46]. Despite its unparalleled resources, the company has been criticized for relative opacity regarding specific preclinical data outputs and pipeline progression.

**Calico Life Sciences**, Alphabet's aging research subsidiary founded in 2013, takes a broad approach to understanding lifespan biology, spanning genetics, computational biology, and drug development using model organisms including naked mole rats [30]. The company's most significant external commitment is its partnership with AbbVie, valued at over $1.5 billion ($500 million each initially with $500 million options), focused on neurodegeneration and cancer [30]. After more than a decade of operation, Calico has produced notable basic research publications (including the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell atlas) but has drawn criticism for limited disclosure of aging-specific therapeutic candidates. Its clinical-stage assets, ABBV-CLS-484 (PTPN2 inhibitor) and ABBV-CLS-579 (SHP2 inhibitor), are primarily immuno-oncology programs rather than direct aging interventions.

**Retro Biosciences** has emerged as one of the most aggressive new entrants, raising a $1 billion Series A at a reported $5 billion valuation in January 2025, following an initial $180 million seed round personally funded by Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) [46]. Retro pursues three parallel approaches to extend healthy human lifespan by 10 years: partial cellular reprogramming, autophagy enhancement (via TFEB/mTORC1 modulation), and plasma-inspired therapeutics [46]. The company planned its first human trial in Australia by end of 2025. Notably, Retro's partnership with OpenAI to leverage AI for protein design and drug discovery represents a high-profile convergence of artificial intelligence and longevity biology [46].

**NewLimit**, co-founded by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong with $105 million in initial investment, focuses specifically on epigenetic reprogramming -- the targeted reversal of age-related epigenetic changes without full cellular reprogramming [46]. The company has pursued ML-guided identification of reprogramming factors and ex vivo T cell rejuvenation, leveraging manufacturing infrastructure analogous to CAR-T cell therapy. Specific pipeline candidates and clinical timelines had not been publicly disclosed as of early 2025.

**BioAge Labs** achieved a notable milestone by completing its IPO on NASDAQ (ticker: BIOA) in September 2024, becoming one of the first publicly traded pure-play longevity companies [30]. The company's genomics and biobank-driven drug discovery platform identified BGE-102 (an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor) as its lead candidate, with a Phase 1 SAD/MAD study planned for the second half of 2025 [30]. BioAge also secured a US patent for novel oral picomolar-potency APJ agonists in May 2025. However, its earlier program azelaprag (a HIF-PHI) delivered disappointing Phase 2 results in late 2024, underscoring the attrition risk inherent to aging-biology drug development.

**Cambrian Biopharma**, led by CEO James Peyer, operates a distributed development platform model, acquiring and advancing early-stage aging biology programs across multiple indications including obesity, respiratory disease, oncology, and immunology [30]. With a reported $1.79 billion valuation and $100 million Series C, Cambrian's portfolio approach provides diversification across aging mechanisms, though it introduces the complexity of managing multiple parallel programs at different stages of development.

### 6.3 Big Pharma Entry and Partnerships

The 2023-2025 period witnessed unprecedented engagement from major pharmaceutical companies with longevity-focused biotechs, signaling mainstream acceptance of aging biology as a viable drug development paradigm.

BioAge Labs secured partnerships with two top-ten pharmaceutical companies within two months: **Novartis** (December 2024) for a collaboration on aging and exercise physiology, and **Eli Lilly's ExploR&D** unit (January 2025) for metabolic aging research [30]. These deals validated BioAge's platform and reflected growing pharma interest in the aging-metabolism interface, particularly in the context of the GLP-1 agonist revolution.

The **AbbVie-Calico** partnership, now entering its second decade, represents the largest single financial commitment between a major pharmaceutical company and an aging-focused entity, with combined investment exceeding $1.5 billion [30]. AbbVie leads clinical development and commercialization of jointly discovered assets, though the pipeline has skewed toward immuno-oncology rather than aging per se.

**HanAll Biopharma** entered a deal valued at up to $300 million with Turn Biotechnologies for ophthalmology and otology applications of Turn's ERA (Epigenetic Reprogramming of Aging) mRNA platform [46]. This transaction validated the commercial potential of mRNA-delivered reprogramming factors for tissue-specific rejuvenation.

Perhaps most consequentially, **Eli Lilly** disclosed plans for a TAME-like (Targeting Aging with Metformin) clinical trial using a GLP-1 receptor agonist, motivated by accumulating evidence that GLP-1 agonists modulate multiple hallmarks of aging beyond metabolic endpoints [24]. If conducted, such a trial would represent the first direct test of a GLP-1 agonist for aging outcomes in a non-diabetic population. At the 2024 ARDD (Aging Research and Drug Discovery) conference in Copenhagen, speakers from both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly publicly engaged with the longevity research community, asking whether GLP-1s might be the first true longevity drugs [24].

Additional pharma-longevity partnerships included **Eli Lilly** deepening its collaboration with **Insilico Medicine** in 2025, and **Sanofi** maintaining a multi-target partnership with Insilico for AI-driven drug discovery [30]. These arrangements suggest that large pharmaceutical companies increasingly view aging biology not as a speculative frontier but as a tractable source of new drug targets and indications.

### 6.4 AI and Computational Approaches

Artificial intelligence has become deeply integrated into longevity drug discovery and aging measurement, with several companies demonstrating quantifiable improvements in pipeline productivity and biomarker development.

**Insilico Medicine** has assembled the most extensive AI-generated drug pipeline in the longevity-adjacent space, producing 20 preclinical candidates between 2021 and 2024 with an average turnaround of 12-18 months from target identification to preclinical candidate -- roughly 3-4 times faster than traditional timelines [30]. Notably, the company achieved a 100% success rate for IND (Investigational New Drug) submissions, with every candidate submitted to regulators being accepted [30]. Their lead program, ISM001-055 (a TRAF2/Nck kinase inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), became the first AI-discovered drug for an AI-identified target to reach Phase IIa with positive efficacy data [30]. The pipeline includes ISM8969, a brain-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor targeting neuroinflammation -- directly relevant to the inflammaging hallmark of aging -- as well as two oral GLP-1 receptor agonists nearing preclinical candidacy [30].

**Deep Longevity** (acquired by Endurance Longevity Inc.) has pioneered Deep Aging Clocks (DACs) that integrate multi-omics data -- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics -- to produce comprehensive biological age estimates [38]. Their Aging.ai platform and commercial deployment in insurance sector biological age-based underwriting represent early monetization of aging clock technology. The AgeMeter suite encompasses BloodAge, PhotoAge (facial photos), PsychAge (questionnaire-based), and MindAge (cognitive assessment), reflecting a trend toward multimodal aging assessment [38].

**Gero AI** (Singapore) developed the GeroSense platform, which uses passively collected wearable device data (step counts, activity patterns) to estimate biological age and mortality risk, outperforming previous models for these endpoints [30]. Their landmark finding -- a fundamental resilience barrier at approximately 120-150 years of human lifespan -- emerged from physics-inspired AI modeling of organism state dynamics [30]. The wearable-based approach democratizes biological age assessment by eliminating the need for blood draws or clinic visits.

**Shift Bioscience** (Cambridge, UK), founded at the Gurdon Institute, raised $16 million in seed funding in October 2024 and announced SB000 in June 2025 -- a novel single-gene target for cellular rejuvenation identified through their AI virtual cell platform [48]. SB000 reportedly achieves cellular rejuvenation at both the methylome and transcriptome levels across multiple cell types without activating pluripotency pathways, representing a fundamentally safer approach than multi-factor Yamanaka reprogramming [48]. However, the gene identity remains proprietary, and the preprint has generated scientific skepticism pending independent replication.

### 6.5 Diagnostics and Consumer-Facing Companies

The biological age testing market has matured considerably, with multiple validated technologies now commercially available at price points between $199 and $499.

**TruDiagnostic** (Lexington, Kentucky; founded 2020) has emerged as the market leader in consumer epigenetic age testing, offering the broadest panel of validated aging clocks in a single commercial test [30]. Their TruAge Complete ($499) and TruAge PACE ($229) products report DunedinPACE (the most clinically validated pace-of-aging metric), OMICmAge (a multi-omic biological age clock), and SYMPHONYAge (a composite aging metric). TruDiagnostic has become the de facto standard for epigenetic age measurement in longevity clinical trials, providing endpoint services for rapamycin, fisetin, and D+Q studies.

**Elysium Health** (New York; founded 2014), backed by 8+ Nobel laureates on its scientific advisory board, bridges diagnostics and therapeutics through its Index biological age test ($299-$499; measuring 10 areas of aging across 9 body systems) and Basis supplement (nicotinamide riboside 250 mg + pterostilbene 50 mg) [30]. The company's dual business model illustrates the convergence of measurement and intervention in the consumer longevity market.

**Tally Health** (New York; co-founded by David Sinclair of Harvard) offers TallyAge ($229), a saliva-based DNA methylation test trained on an 8,000+ person dataset [30]. The non-invasive cheek swab approach lowers the barrier to testing, though Sinclair's involvement has drawn both marketing visibility and conflict-of-interest scrutiny from the academic community.

**GlycanAge** (London/Zagreb; founded 2020) provides a distinct modality from epigenetic clocks, measuring glycosylation patterns on IgG antibodies that reflect immune system aging and chronic inflammation [30]. Backed by 200+ scientific publications, the glycan-based approach offers complementary information to methylation clocks and may be more responsive to short-term lifestyle interventions.

The consumer diagnostics segment collectively represents a market shift toward quantified self-monitoring of aging, enabling both individual health optimization and clinical trial endpoint measurement. However, standardization across clock technologies remains a challenge, with different tests occasionally yielding discordant results for the same individual [37].

### 6.6 Regulatory Developments and FDA Engagement

Several regulatory milestones between 2023 and 2025 established important precedents for the longevity therapeutic field.

The **TAME trial** (Targeting Aging with Metformin) achieved a historic regulatory outcome: the FDA agreed that aging could be treated as a clinical indication, accepting a composite endpoint of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and death as a valid primary outcome for a geroscience trial [35]. This decision, while not constituting formal approval of an aging indication, established a framework under which future longevity therapeutics could pursue regulatory pathways. The trial, now enrolling 3,000 non-diabetic adults aged 65-79 under the ARPA-H framework, is expected to complete by 2027-2028 [35].

**Loyal**, the veterinary longevity company, achieved two regulatory firsts for lifespan extension therapeutics. In February 2025, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine accepted Loyal's Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness (RXE) package for LOY-002, a caloric restriction mimetic for senior dogs [30]. In January 2026, the Technical Section (TAS) was accepted, advancing the drug toward Experimental Conditional Approval (XCA) [30]. Loyal's STAY study -- enrolling over 1,000 dogs across 70 clinical sites -- constitutes the largest veterinary clinical trial in history, with the first dog dosed in December 2023 [30]. If approved, LOY-002 would become the first FDA-approved lifespan extension drug in any species, potentially establishing a regulatory template transferable to human longevity therapeutics.

**Rubedo Life Sciences** obtained FDA IND clearance for RLS-1496, a selective GPX4 modulator that induces ferroptosis selectively in senescent cells, in September 2025 for actinic keratosis [45]. An EMA-cleared trial for psoriasis, dermatitis, and skin aging began in May 2025 with first patient dosed [45]. The dual US/EU regulatory strategy and novel mechanism of action (ferroptosis-based senolysis, distinct from BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibition) represent a meaningful expansion of the senolytic clinical pipeline.

**Unity Biotechnology** published its Phase 2b ASPIRE trial results for UBX1325 (foselutoclax) in *NEJM Evidence*, demonstrating that a single intravitreal injection of this BCL-xL inhibitor produced 5.6 ETDRS letters improvement versus sham at 48 weeks in diabetic macular edema [5]. While the earlier BEHOLD Phase 2 trial had failed to meet its primary endpoint at 24 weeks [5], the positive ASPIRE data and publication in a high-impact journal provided significant clinical validation for the senolytic therapeutic hypothesis.

## 7. Clinical Trial Landscape

### 7.1 Overview of Active and Completed Trials

The longevity clinical trial landscape has expanded considerably since 2023, encompassing a diverse array of interventions, indications, and trial designs. As of early 2025, more than 30 clinical trials of senolytic and senomorphic agents had been completed or were actively recruiting [29], while a broader analysis by PolicyLab identified 133 aging-specific trials actively recruiting participants across global registries [29].

The geographic distribution of trials reflects the investment landscape: the United States hosts the majority of trials, with significant activity at the Mayo Clinic (senolytics: D+Q, fisetin), academic medical centers (rapamycin: University of Adelaide, AgelessRx), and industry sponsors (NMN: Metro International Biotech; urolithin A: Amazentis) [29]. European contributions include the POLYCAD spermidine trial (Medical University of Graz) [39], Rubedo's EMA-cleared senolytic trial (May 2025) [45], and the Odense University Hospital D+Q osteoporosis trial [29]. Australia serves as an increasingly important jurisdiction for first-in-human longevity trials, with Retro Biosciences planning its inaugural human study there [46].

Trial phase distribution reveals a field still weighted toward early-stage investigation: the majority of completed trials are Phase 1 or Phase 2 safety/dose-finding studies, with only two large-scale Phase 3 trials in the longevity space -- TAME (metformin, enrolling) and PROTECTOR (RTB101, failed) [35]. The semaglutide SELECT and STEP-HFpEF trials, while not designed as longevity studies, have generated some of the most compelling clinical data relevant to aging endpoints [7].

### 7.2 Key Results from 2023-2025

**PEARL Trial (Rapamycin).** The Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity trial was the first long-duration randomized controlled trial of rapamycin in healthy aging adults [4]. The 48-week study enrolled 114 participants aged 50-85 who received placebo, 5 mg, or 10 mg compounded rapamycin weekly. Low-dose, intermittent rapamycin was confirmed to be relatively safe, with adverse events similar across groups. The study detected dose-dependent and sex-specific effects: women on 10 mg weekly showed improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain, while men showed improved bone mineral content. The 5 mg group reported improved general health self-assessments [4]. A critical caveat was that the compounded rapamycin formulation had approximately one-third the bioavailability of commercial formulations, complicating dose-response interpretation. While the safety data are reassuring, the modest and variable efficacy signals indicate that larger, longer trials with pharmaceutical-grade formulations will be needed to establish rapamycin's geroprotective potential in humans.

**ASPIRE Trial (UBX1325/Foselutoclax).** Unity Biotechnology's Phase 2b ASPIRE trial demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325, a BCL-xL inhibitor targeting retinal senescent cells, produced 5.6 additional ETDRS letters versus sham at 48 weeks in patients with diabetic macular edema (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7) [5]. The 48-week durability from a single injection was notable, as standard-of-care anti-VEGF therapies require monthly or bimonthly injections. UBX1325 was non-inferior to aflibercept at most time points through 36 weeks and outperformed aflibercept in patients with central subfield thickness below 400 microns [5]. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation. These results represent the most advanced clinical proof-of-concept for senolytic therapy to date.

**MitoImmune Study (Urolithin A).** Published in *Nature Aging* in 2025, this randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that urolithin A (Mitopure) at 1000 mg/day for just 4 weeks expanded peripheral naive-like CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 percentage points; P=0.0437), increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 percentage points; P=0.0061), and reduced inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) in 50 healthy middle-aged adults [6]. These findings constitute the first clinical evidence that a mitophagy activator can reverse immunosenescence markers in humans within 28 days, opening a new therapeutic axis for age-related immune decline.

**Semaglutide and Epigenetic Aging.** A preprint published on *medRxiv* in 2025 reported that semaglutide significantly decreased multiple epigenetic aging clocks in a 32-week trial of people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy: PCGrimAge (-3.1 years, P=0.007), GrimAge V1 (-1.4 years, P=0.02), GrimAge V2 (-2.3 years, P=0.009), PhenoAge (-4.9 years, P=0.004), and DunedinPACE (-0.09 units, approximately 9% slower pace, P=0.01) [7]. Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart. This provides the first clinical trial evidence that a GLP-1 receptor agonist modulates validated epigenetic biomarkers of aging, dramatically strengthening the case for GLP-1 agonists as potential geroprotective agents.

**GlyNAC Supplementation.** Kumar et al. (2023) published the results of a 16-week placebo-controlled RCT in 24 older adults aged 70-80, demonstrating that glycine + N-acetylcysteine (GlyNAC) supplementation corrected glutathione deficiency, reduced oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function, reduced inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha), improved insulin resistance, endothelial function, body composition, cognition, gait speed, grip strength, and exercise capacity [12]. The breadth of simultaneous improvements across multiple aging hallmarks was remarkable for a simple, inexpensive nutritional intervention. Importantly, benefits reversed upon cessation of supplementation, indicating that ongoing use would be necessary [12].

**NR/NMN Clinical Results.** NAD+ precursor supplementation continued to generate mixed functional results. NMN at 250 mg/day improved muscle insulin sensitivity by approximately 25% in prediabetic postmenopausal women (Yoshino et al., *Science*) [18] and at similar doses improved walking speed and sleep quality in older adults (Kim et al., *GeroScience* 2024) [18]. However, a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs encompassing 513 participants found that while NMN reliably elevated blood NAD+, most clinically relevant glucose and lipid metabolism outcomes were not significantly different from placebo, with the authors cautioning that "an exaggeration of the benefits of NMN supplementation may exist in the field" [19]. NR similarly increased blood NAD+ and PBMC mitochondrial respiration in heart failure patients, but failed to improve cardiac function, exercise capacity, or clinical endpoints [10]. An NR trial in mild cognitive impairment confirmed CNS bioavailability but did not achieve significant cognitive improvement [10]. The emerging consensus is a "NAD+ paradox": precursor supplementation reliably elevates circulating NAD+ but inconsistently translates to functional clinical benefits [19].

### 7.3 Trial Design Challenges in Aging Research

The design of clinical trials for aging interventions presents unique methodological challenges that have constrained the field's translational progress.

**Composite versus single-disease endpoints.** The TAME trial's composite endpoint (cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, or death) reflects the geroscience hypothesis that aging is a common upstream driver of multiple chronic diseases [35]. While scientifically sound, this design requires large sample sizes (n=3,000 for TAME) and extended follow-up periods (estimated completion 2027-2028) to accumulate sufficient events [35]. The regulatory acceptance of this composite endpoint was a breakthrough, but the practical burden of such trials limits their scalability.

**Long follow-up periods.** Aging outcomes by definition develop over years to decades, creating a tension between the need for clinically meaningful endpoints and the practical constraints of trial duration and funding. The Dog Aging Project's TRIAD trial (rapamycin in 580 companion dogs) has a 3-year treatment period with estimated completion in 2027-2029 [30], illustrating how even veterinary longevity trials require multi-year commitments.

**Biological age as a surrogate endpoint.** There is growing momentum toward adopting epigenetic clocks -- particularly DunedinPACE and GrimAge -- as primary or co-primary endpoints in aging trials [37, 38]. The semaglutide epigenetic aging data [7] and the PEARL trial's inclusion of epigenetic age as a secondary endpoint [4] exemplify this trend. However, surrogate endpoint validation requires demonstrating that changes in the biomarker reliably predict changes in clinical outcomes, a threshold that no epigenetic clock has yet formally met in a regulatory context [37].

**Recruitment of "healthy aging" populations.** Trials testing geroprotective interventions in ostensibly healthy older adults face recruitment challenges distinct from disease-focused trials: participants may lack disease motivation, dropout rates may be higher, and placebo effects in self-reported outcomes can be substantial. The PEARL trial's use of a compounded rapamycin formulation (with reduced bioavailability) illustrates the supply-chain challenges of testing repurposed drugs in non-standard populations [4].

### 7.4 Emerging Endpoints and Surrogate Markers

The development of validated surrogate markers for biological aging is arguably the single greatest enabler for scaling longevity clinical trials.

**Epigenetic clocks** have achieved the most advanced level of clinical validation. DunedinPACE, a third-generation pace-of-aging clock, measures the rate of biological aging rather than a static age estimate, and has been validated against mortality, morbidity, and functional decline in multiple independent cohorts [37]. GrimAge (versions 1 and 2) integrates DNA methylation surrogates for plasma proteins and smoking pack-years, predicting time-to-death with greater accuracy than first-generation Horvath or Hannum clocks [37]. Approximately 28% of the human genome encompasses age-related methylation sites, providing a rich substrate for clock development [37]. AI-powered deep aging clocks that capture non-linear interactions are beginning to outperform linear regression-based models, with multi-modal integration (epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, medical imaging) representing the current frontier [38].

**SASP factor panels** -- measuring circulating senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteins including IL-6, MMP-3, MMP-9, PAI-1, and p16INK4a -- have been adopted as secondary endpoints in most senolytic clinical trials [29]. The STAMINA pilot demonstrated correlation between TNF-alpha reduction and cognitive improvement following D+Q treatment, providing initial evidence that SASP modulation tracks with functional outcomes [16].

**Circulating NAD+ levels** serve as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for NAD+ precursor trials, with MIB-626 demonstrating a two-fold increase in blood NAD+ at 1000 mg/day [18]. However, the disconnect between NAD+ elevation and functional outcomes has tempered enthusiasm for NAD+ as a standalone surrogate for aging [19].

**Frailty indices** -- including the Fried Frailty Phenotype and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) -- remain clinically intuitive endpoints with established prognostic validity. Composite frailty assessments combining gait speed, grip strength, and self-reported function are increasingly used as co-primary endpoints in senolytic trials [29].

### 7.5 Notable Failures and Lessons Learned

The longevity field's clinical failures have been as instructive as its successes, providing critical lessons for trial design and target selection.

**RTB101 PROTECTOR Trial.** The Phase 3 PROTECTOR trial of RTB101 (a catalytic mTORC1 inhibitor developed by resTORbio) in 652 elderly adults failed to reduce laboratory-confirmed respiratory tract infections versus placebo [15]. This failure was particularly impactful because Phase 2b data had shown a 30.6% reduction in respiratory infections when RTB101 was combined with low-dose everolimus [20]. The monotherapy failure suggested that the combination's efficacy may have derived primarily from everolimus rather than RTB101, and that catalytic mTOR inhibition alone was insufficient for immune enhancement. resTORbio's stock dropped approximately 75%, and the company was subsequently acquired. The investigators (Joan Mannick and Lloyd Schor) went on to co-found Tornado Therapeutics in 2022 for refined mTOR strategies [15]. The PROTECTOR failure underscored the risk of extrapolating combination therapy results to monotherapy, and the difficulty of translating mTOR biology into simple clinical applications.

**BEHOLD Phase 2 (UBX1325 for DME).** Unity Biotechnology's BEHOLD trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant best-corrected visual acuity improvement versus sham at 24 weeks [5]. However, the subsequent ASPIRE Phase 2b trial achieved the 5.6-letter improvement at 48 weeks, suggesting that the BEHOLD failure may have reflected an inadequate follow-up period rather than drug inefficacy. This sequence illustrates a design lesson specific to senolytic therapy: because senescent cell clearance initiates a biological cascade that takes weeks to months to manifest as functional improvement, trial endpoints assessed too early may miss genuine therapeutic effects [5].

**NMN/NR Mixed Functional Results.** As discussed in Section 7.2, the consistent pattern of NAD+ elevation without proportional functional benefit across multiple NMN and NR trials suggests that age-related NAD+ decline may be a consequence rather than a cause of cellular dysfunction, or that supplementation does not adequately reach the intracellular compartments where NAD+ is most needed [19]. A 2024 meta-analysis of 12 NMN RCTs found minimal benefits for sarcopenia and muscle function in adults over 60, with several studies flagged for high risk of bias [19]. The CD38 inhibitor hypothesis -- that blocking the primary NADase responsible for age-related NAD+ degradation may be more effective than supplementing precursors -- remains to be tested clinically [19].

**Metformin and Exercise Blunting.** While not a trial failure per se, accumulating evidence that metformin may attenuate exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations in older adults has complicated the TAME trial's interpretation framework [35]. A 2025 critical review in *Ageing Research Reviews* characterized "emerging uncertainty on the anti-aging potential of metformin" in non-diabetic populations, noting methodological limitations in early influential observational studies (including the widely cited Bannister 2014 finding that diabetics on metformin outlived non-diabetic controls) [35]. The TAME trial results, expected by 2027-2028, will be essential to resolve this uncertainty [35].

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 Most Promising Near-Term Opportunities

Several intervention categories have converged on sufficient preclinical evidence, clinical proof-of-concept, and regulatory pathway clarity to warrant designation as near-term therapeutic opportunities.

**Senolytics** represent the most clinically advanced longevity intervention class. UBX1325's ASPIRE data (5.6 letters improvement, 48-week durability, *NEJM Evidence* publication) [5], Rubedo's dual FDA/EMA IND clearance for RLS-1496 [45], and the expanding pipeline of D+Q trials across Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, frailty, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis collectively indicate that senolytic therapy is approaching a clinical inflection point [29]. The emergence of next-generation approaches -- including senolytic CAR T cells providing prophylactic protection for over one year from a single low dose [28] and senoblockers that prevent senescence rather than clearing it [29] -- suggests a deepening therapeutic toolkit.

**GLP-1 receptor agonists**, while not designed as longevity drugs, have generated the most extensive real-world evidence base relevant to aging. The SELECT trial's 20% MACE reduction and 19% all-cause mortality reduction in 17,604 non-diabetic adults [7], combined with the semaglutide epigenetic clock data showing up to 4.9-year reductions in PhenoAge [7], and the ongoing EVOKE/EVOKE+ Phase 3 trial for early Alzheimer's disease (n=3,700) [7], collectively position GLP-1 agonists as potential first-generation geroprotective agents. The question of whether Eli Lilly will proceed with a TAME-like healthy aging trial using a GLP-1 agonist could define the trajectory of the field [24].

**Mitophagy activators**, particularly urolithin A, have built one of the most robust clinical evidence bases for any supplement-grade aging intervention, with 25+ registered human trials, $50 million in R&D investment, publication in *Nature Aging* (MitoImmune immune rejuvenation data) [6], and the large-scale CLARITY trial (n=650, brain health endpoints, results expected March 2026) [6]. The commercial availability of Mitopure makes this intervention immediately accessible while pharmaceutical-grade development continues.

### 8.2 Translational Gaps and Challenges

Despite accelerating progress, significant translational gaps persist. The most dramatic preclinical results -- 109% remaining lifespan extension via AAV-OSK partial reprogramming in mice [3], 30% lifespan extension via SIRT6 overexpression [25], and 41.4% extension via MCMV-TERT gene therapy [26] -- involve genetic interventions that face formidable delivery, safety, and manufacturing challenges before human translation. The gap between preclinical lifespan extension magnitudes and the modest effects observed in human trials (e.g., PEARL's sex-specific lean tissue improvements [4]; GlyNAC's broad but small-sample benefits [12]) underscores the difficulty of recapitulating mouse aging biology in human physiology.

Bioavailability remains a critical bottleneck for several promising natural compounds. Fisetin, the most potent senolytic flavonoid identified in cell-based screening, undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism with low aqueous solubility, limiting its systemic bioavailability [13]. Similarly, spermidine's cognitive effects have been inconsistent across trials, potentially reflecting variable gut absorption and bioavailability [20]. Novel delivery systems -- including liposomal formulations, lipid nanoparticles, and prodrug strategies -- are being developed to address these limitations but add complexity and cost.

Target validation also remains incomplete for several intervention classes. The finding that somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks are measuring epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations [41]. If the latter, then epigenetic rejuvenation therapies may address symptoms rather than root causes of aging, with implications for the durability and depth of therapeutic effects.

### 8.3 Safety and Ethical Considerations

Long-term safety remains the primary concern for chronic geroprotective interventions. Rapamycin, despite the most robust preclinical lifespan extension data of any pharmacological agent (9-26% in mice) [4, 15], carries immunosuppressive risks at standard doses that must be carefully distinguished from the immune-enhancing effects observed at low intermittent doses [4, 20]. The PEARL trial's confirmation of safety at 5-10 mg weekly in healthy adults [4] is encouraging but insufficient to characterize risk over the decades-long exposure that would be required for a true geroprotective agent.

Cellular reprogramming therapies raise the specter of tumorigenesis. The Yamanaka factor c-Myc is a known oncogene, leading most groups to use OSK (omitting c-Myc), but even OSK carries risk if expression is not precisely controlled [3]. The identification of single-gene targets such as SB000 that bypass pluripotency pathways represents a safety advancement [48], though extensive in vivo validation will be required.

Ethical considerations also attend the growing consumer diagnostics market. Biological age tests marketed directly to consumers may generate anxiety without actionable clinical guidance, particularly when different clock technologies yield discordant results [37]. The commercialization of aging interventions -- particularly supplements marketed with anti-aging claims based on preclinical data -- raises concerns about premature consumer adoption ahead of clinical evidence [19].

### 8.4 The Healthspan vs. Lifespan Debate

A conceptual tension persists within the longevity field between maximizing lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health). Most clinical trials, regulatory discussions, and public communication have converged on healthspan as the more tractable and ethically defensible goal. The TAME trial's composite endpoint (delay of age-related disease onset rather than extension of maximum lifespan) [35], Loyal's focus on quality of life in senior dogs [30], and the emphasis on functional outcomes (gait speed, muscle strength, cognition) in senolytic trials [29] all reflect this framing.

However, the distinction is partly artificial. Preclinical interventions that extend lifespan typically do so by compressing morbidity rather than extending the period of decline. Rapamycin-treated mice do not merely live longer; they maintain youthful phenotypes longer and then decline relatively rapidly [4, 15]. Partial reprogramming extends remaining lifespan by 109% in mice while simultaneously improving health metrics [3]. The SIRT6 overexpression model explicitly preserves "vigorous physical activity equivalent to young mice into old age" alongside the 30% lifespan extension [25].

The practical convergence of healthspan and lifespan goals suggests that the distinction is most useful as a communication strategy rather than a scientific dichotomy. Interventions that delay the onset of age-related dysfunction will inherently extend both healthy and total lifespan.

### 8.5 Convergence of AI and Longevity Science

The integration of artificial intelligence into longevity research has progressed beyond computational convenience to become a defining feature of the field's trajectory. This convergence operates at three levels.

First, **AI-driven drug discovery** has compressed timelines for target identification and compound optimization. Insilico Medicine's 12-18 month target-to-preclinical-candidate cycle (versus 4-6 years conventionally) and 100% IND success rate demonstrate quantifiable gains in pipeline productivity [30]. The Retro Biosciences-OpenAI partnership for AI-designed proteins that temporarily convert regular cells into stem cells represents a frontier integration of generative AI and reprogramming biology [46].

Second, **AI-powered biological age assessment** has advanced from simple regression models to deep learning systems capable of integrating multimodal data [38]. The transition from Horvath's first-generation clock (2013) to DunedinPACE (third-generation, pace-of-aging) and now to deep aging clocks integrating imaging, proteomics, and behavioral data reflects an accelerating sophistication that will improve endpoint measurement for clinical trials [37, 38].

Third, **computational modeling of aging** -- exemplified by Shift Bioscience's AI virtual cell platform [48] and Gero AI's physics-inspired organism state models [30] -- is beginning to generate testable hypotheses about minimal interventions needed for rejuvenation. These platforms may enable the identification of single-gene or low-complexity interventions that achieve disproportionate rejuvenation effects.

## 9. Future Directions

### 9.1 Predicted Breakthroughs 2025-2028

The 2025-2028 window is likely to yield several landmark results that will define the field's next decade. The TAME trial completion (estimated 2027-2028) will provide the first definitive data on whether metformin delays composite age-related disease in non-diabetic adults [35]. Results from the CLARITY trial (n=650, urolithin A for brain health, March 2026) will establish whether mitophagy activation produces neurological benefits at scale [6]. The EVOKE/EVOKE+ trials (n=3,700, oral semaglutide for early Alzheimer's, estimated 2025-2026) will determine whether GLP-1 agonism modifies neurodegenerative disease trajectory [7]. The Dog Aging Project's TRIAD trial (n=580, rapamycin in companion dogs, estimated 2027-2029) will provide the first lifespan-as-primary-endpoint data for a pharmacological intervention in a mammalian species [30].

On the regulatory front, Loyal's LOY-002 may achieve FDA conditional approval as the first lifespan extension drug in any species [30]. Altos Labs' ongoing human safety testing of reprogramming-based therapies, combined with Retro Biosciences' planned Australian human trial, will provide the first human safety data for partial reprogramming approaches [46]. Rubedo's Phase 1b/2a data for RLS-1496 will expand the clinical evidence base for novel senolytic mechanisms [45].

### 9.2 Technologies to Watch

**Senolytic immunotherapies** -- including uPAR-targeting CAR T cells [28] and senolytic vaccines -- represent a paradigm shift from repeated small-molecule dosing to one-and-done living drug approaches. If the prophylactic efficacy demonstrated in mice (>1 year from a single low dose) [28] translates to humans, senolytic CAR T cells could provide durable senescent cell surveillance that small molecules cannot match.

**Chemical reprogramming** -- the replacement of transcription factor-based Yamanaka cocktails with small-molecule combinations that achieve equivalent epigenetic rejuvenation -- could dramatically simplify delivery and improve safety profiles for reprogramming therapies. Early-stage work in this direction has been reported from multiple laboratories, including efforts at Altos Labs.

**cGAS-STING pathway inhibitors** have emerged as high-priority targets for inflammaging following the demonstration that STING blockade improves memory and physical function in aged mice [8] and the discovery that aging activates a noncanonical cGAS-STING pathway distinct from canonical activation [9]. Multiple pharmaceutical companies are developing STING inhibitors for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, creating potential repurposing opportunities for aging indications.

**Microbiome-based therapeutics**, including targeted probiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, address the dysbiosis hallmark of aging through modulation of short-chain fatty acid production, epithelial barrier integrity, and systemic inflammation [32]. The addition of dysbiosis as a hallmark in the 2023 Lopez-Otin update has focused investment and research attention on this underexplored therapeutic axis [1].

### 9.3 Key Unanswered Questions

Several fundamental questions will shape the field's trajectory:

1. **Are epigenetic clocks measuring causes or consequences of aging?** The finding that somatic mutations drive cascading epigenetic changes [41] raises the question of whether epigenetic rejuvenation addresses root causes or symptoms. Resolution of this question has profound implications for the entire reprogramming therapeutic paradigm.

2. **Can partial reprogramming be made safe enough for chronic human use?** The 109% remaining lifespan extension in mice [3] is extraordinary, but tumor risk from even transient Yamanaka factor expression remains the central safety concern. Single-gene approaches like SB000 [48] and chemical reprogramming may provide paths forward.

3. **Do GLP-1 agonists have true geroprotective effects independent of metabolic improvement?** The epigenetic clock data [7] and multi-organ benefit profile are suggestive, but most evidence comes from metabolically unhealthy cohorts. A TAME-like trial in healthy populations would be definitive [24].

4. **What is the optimal combination of geroprotective interventions?** The multi-hallmark nature of aging [1] suggests that no single intervention will be sufficient. Whether rational polytherapy (e.g., a senolytic + autophagy activator + NAD+ modulator) produces synergistic benefits is largely untested in humans.

5. **Can biological age reversal be sustained?** GlyNAC benefits reversed upon cessation [12]. Whether other interventions produce durable rejuvenation or require chronic administration will determine the practical feasibility and cost of longevity therapeutics.

## 10. Conclusion

The longevity research field between 2023 and 2025 has undergone a transition from speculative science to clinical medicine. The updated hallmarks of aging framework (now 12 hallmarks) [1] provides a coherent organizational schema for an increasingly diverse array of interventions, from small-molecule senolytics reaching Phase 2b [5] to gene therapy-mediated partial reprogramming extending mouse lifespan by over 100% [3]. Investment has surged to $8.49 billion in 2024 [30], major pharmaceutical companies have entered longevity-focused partnerships [24, 30], and the FDA has accepted aging as a treatable indication [35].

The clinical evidence base, while still emerging, has produced several validated proof-of-concept results: UBX1325's durable senolytic effect in diabetic macular edema [5], urolithin A's immune rejuvenation in 28 days [6], semaglutide's epigenetic clock reversal [7], and GlyNAC's multi-hallmark improvements [12]. Counterbalancing these successes, the RTB101 Phase 3 failure [15], UBX1325's initial BEHOLD failure [5], and the NAD+ precursor efficacy gap [19] demonstrate that translating aging biology into therapeutics remains fraught with the attrition and complexity inherent to all drug development.

The convergence of AI-driven drug discovery, validated biological aging biomarkers, expanding clinical trial infrastructure, and growing regulatory engagement positions the longevity field for its most consequential period of clinical data generation in 2025-2028. Whether this period delivers the breakthrough results needed to establish geroprotective medicine as a clinical reality will depend on rigorous trial design, transparent reporting of both positive and negative results, and sustained investment through the long timelines that aging research inherently demands.
