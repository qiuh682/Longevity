## 4. Pharmacological Interventions: Evidence Review

The pharmacological targeting of aging mechanisms has advanced from theoretical possibility to clinical reality over the period 2023--2025. This section evaluates the evidence base for each major intervention class, emphasizing human data where available and contextualizing preclinical findings with appropriate caveats regarding translational uncertainty. Throughout, we note both positive and null results, as the field's maturation depends critically on honest appraisal of failures alongside successes.

### 4.1 Senolytics and Senomorphics

Cellular senescence, now firmly established as a causal driver of age-related pathology [1], represents one of the most actively targeted hallmarks of aging. Senolytic compounds---agents that selectively eliminate senescent cells by disrupting senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs)---have progressed through multiple clinical trials since the first human proof-of-concept in 2019 [2].

**Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q).** The combination of the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib (100 mg) with the flavonoid quercetin (1000--1250 mg), administered intermittently for 3 consecutive days per cycle, remains the most extensively studied senolytic regimen. Dasatinib targets ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases preferentially in senescent preadipocytes, while quercetin inhibits BCL-2/BCL-xL and PI3K/AKT survival pathways more effectively in senescent endothelial and bone marrow stem cells [3]. The STAMINA pilot study enrolled 12 older adults (age >= 65) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and slow gait speed, administering D+Q over 12 weeks. The regimen was safe, with no serious adverse events; mean MoCA scores increased by 2.0 points (95% CI: 0.1--4.0) in those with lowest baseline scores, and reductions in TNF-alpha correlated with cognitive improvements [4]. The SToMP-AD Phase 2 trial (NCT04685590) at Wake Forest University is evaluating intermittent D+Q in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (n ~ 20), with CSF senescence markers and brain MRI as primary endpoints; interim data confirm acceptable tolerability [5]. A Phase 1 trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) demonstrated feasibility and tolerability (PMID: 36857968) [6]. An osteoporosis Phase 2 trial (NCT06018467) at Odense University Hospital is active with results expected in 2026, and a Phase 2 pilot protocol for mental disorders was accepted in February 2025 (PMC12120425) [7]. However, an emerging safety concern arose in 2024 when kidney damage was observed in an acute folic acid nephropathy model, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and monitoring [8].

**Fisetin.** Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) was identified as the most potent senolytic flavonoid in screening studies, demonstrating approximately 50% greater senolytic potency than quercetin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [9]. In a Mayo Clinic study of 536 long-COVID patients, 44 who received fisetin reported a 64% rate of significant symptom alleviation [10]. The TROFFi Phase II RCT in frail breast cancer survivors is active (ASCO 2024 abstract: JCO.2024.42.16_suppl.TPS1645) [11]. The STOP-Sepsis trial completed recruitment of 220 elderly sepsis patients in 2025 [12], and additional trials are evaluating fisetin for healthy aging (NCT07195318) and vascular function in older adults (NCT06133634) [13]. A critical limitation is fisetin's poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism and low aqueous solubility, which may explain the inconsistency between in vitro potency and clinical effect sizes [14]. The AFFINITY trial (NCT03675724) of fisetin 20 mg/kg/day for frailty in older women showed mixed results---some SASP markers improved while others did not reach statistical significance [15].

**Navitoclax (ABT-263).** Navitoclax is a potent BH3-mimetic BCL-2/BCL-xL/BCL-w inhibitor (Ki < 1 nM) whose senolytic activity derives from the critical dependence of senescent cells on BCL-xL for survival [16]. Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia---arising because BCL-xL is essential for platelet survival---has precluded systemic aging-indication development. Recent work has focused on circumventing this toxicity: topical application on aged mouse skin demonstrated efficacy in December 2024 [17], and prodrug strategies (galactose-conjugated Nav-Gal, PZ-15227) preferentially target beta-galactosidase-expressing senescent cells while sparing platelets [18]. Navitoclax has also shown efficacy in glioma and diffuse midline glioma models (2025) [19]. No dedicated aging clinical trials are registered as of early 2025.

**UBX1325 (Foselutoclax).** Unity Biotechnology's intravitreal BCL-xL inhibitor represents the most clinically advanced senolytic program. In the ASPIRE Phase 2b trial, a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325 in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) achieved a gain of 5.6 ETDRS letters versus sham at week 48 (95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7), published in *NEJM Evidence* [20]. The 48-week durability from a single injection is remarkable. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation, and no systemic thrombocytopenia was observed, confirming that local delivery avoids systemic BCL-xL inhibition [20]. However, the earlier BEHOLD Phase 2 trial (NCT04857996, n = 63) failed its primary endpoint of BCVA improvement at week 24, illustrating the importance of trial design---the longer 48-week follow-up in ASPIRE captured durability effects that the 24-week BEHOLD did not [21]. Unity secured $55M Series C funding in 2024 to advance the program [22].

**RLS-1496 (Rubedo Life Sciences).** RLS-1496 is a first-in-class GPX4 modulator that targets the ferroptosis vulnerability of pathological senescent cells. The FDA cleared its IND application in September 2025 for a Phase 1b/2a study in actinic keratosis, and the EMA cleared a clinical trial for plaque psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and skin aging that began in May 2025 [23]. This novel mechanism---distinct from BCL-2 family targeting---broadens the senolytic armamentarium.

**Senolytic CAR T Cells.** Amor et al. demonstrated that CAR T cells targeting uPAR on senescent cells provided prophylactic protection against age-related metabolic decline lasting over one year from a single low dose in mice, far exceeding the durability of small-molecule senolytics [24]. This paradigm shift from repeated small-molecule administration to "one-and-done" immunotherapy-based senolysis has significant implications for clinical translation, though manufacturing complexity and cost remain barriers.

**Safety and Therapeutic Windows.** The senolytic field confronts a fundamental safety-efficacy tradeoff: the most potent agents (navitoclax) carry the greatest toxicity. Strategies to improve therapeutic windows include intermittent "hit-and-run" dosing (D+Q), local delivery (UBX1325 intravitreal), prodrug activation in senescent cells (Nav-Gal), and novel targets (GPX4 modulation, CAR T). More than 30 senolytic clinical trials have been completed or are underway as of early 2025 [25].

### 4.2 mTOR Pathway Modulators

Inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) remains the most robustly replicated pharmacological lifespan extension intervention in mammals [26]. The period 2023--2025 has seen the first rigorous randomized controlled trial data in healthy aging adults.

**Rapamycin.** The PEARL trial (NCT04488601) is the landmark study of this period: a 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT enrolling 114 healthy adults aged 50--85 who received 5 mg or 10 mg compounded rapamycin weekly versus placebo (PMC12074816) [27]. The trial confirmed that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin was safe and well-tolerated, with adverse events similar across groups. Efficacy signals were modest and sex-specific: women on 10 mg showed improved lean tissue mass and reduced pain; the 5 mg group showed improved emotional well-being and general health self-reports [27]. A critical limitation was that compounded rapamycin had approximately one-third the bioavailability of commercial formulations, potentially underestimating effects [27]. A comprehensive 2025 review in the *Aging* journal concluded that there is "no clear clinical evidence" that preclinical benefits translate to humans, while acknowledging that clinical data remain preliminary [28].

The combination of rapamycin with acarbose achieved a 36.6% increase in median lifespan in mice in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP)---one of the largest pharmacological lifespan extensions ever recorded [29]. No human combination trial has been initiated.

An Alzheimer's Phase 1 pilot study of rapamycin published in *Nature Communications Medicine* (2025) is exploring mTOR inhibition in neurodegeneration [30]. The Dog Aging Project TRIAD trial (NCT04614428) is testing low-dose rapamycin in 580 middle-aged companion dogs with lifespan as the primary endpoint, following a pilot showing improved diastolic cardiac function [31].

**Everolimus.** The paradigm-shifting Mannick et al. 2014 trial demonstrated that low-dose everolimus (0.5 mg/day or 5 mg weekly) enhanced influenza vaccine response by approximately 20% in 218 healthy older adults (age >= 65), simultaneously reducing PD-1 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells [32]. The 2018 follow-up combining everolimus with RTB101 reduced respiratory tract infections by 30.6% (p = 0.008) in 264 elderly volunteers [33]. The EVERLAST trial (NCT05835999) is evaluating low-dose everolimus in older adults with completion expected late 2026 [34]. A sirolimus trial for preventing functional decline (NCT05237687) is recruiting in 2025 [35].

**Dose-Response and the Immunosuppression Paradox.** The counter-intuitive finding that low-dose mTOR inhibition enhances rather than suppresses immune function [32] has reshaped the field's understanding of this drug class. However, the RTB101 PROTECTOR Phase 3 trial (NCT03693612, n ~ 652) demonstrated that the catalytic mTOR inhibitor RTB101 as monotherapy failed to reduce respiratory infections in elderly adults, leading to a ~75% stock decline for resTORbio [36]. This failure underscores that not all modes of mTOR modulation are equivalent and that combination strategies may be necessary.

| Agent | Trial | n | Duration | Key Finding | Ref |
|-------|-------|---|----------|-------------|-----|
| Rapamycin 5/10 mg weekly | PEARL | 114 | 48 weeks | Safe; modest sex-specific improvements | [27] |
| Rapamycin + acarbose | ITP (mice) | -- | Lifetime | 36.6% median lifespan extension | [29] |
| Everolimus 0.5 mg/day | Mannick 2014 | 218 | 6 weeks | ~20% vaccine titer increase | [32] |
| Everolimus + RTB101 | Mannick 2018 | 264 | 16 weeks | 30.6% infection reduction (p=0.008) | [33] |
| RTB101 monotherapy | PROTECTOR Phase 3 | 652 | 16 weeks | **Failed** primary endpoint | [36] |

### 4.3 NAD+ Metabolism

NAD+ declines approximately 50% between ages 40 and 60, driven by increased CD38 expression, elevated PARP activity, and decreased NAMPT expression [37]. Restoring NAD+ levels through precursor supplementation has been a major focus of both academic research and the consumer supplement industry.

**NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide).** NMN is converted to NAD+ in a single enzymatic step by NMNATs. A 12-week RCT in 60 older adults showed that 250 mg/day NMN significantly increased blood NAD+, improved walking speed, and enhanced sleep quality versus placebo (PMID: 38789831) [38]. A February 2025 trial demonstrated that 350 mg/day liposomal NMN significantly increased NAD+ compared with non-liposomal formulations over 4 weeks [39]. However, a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (250--2000 mg/day, 513 participants) found no significant benefit on fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or lipid profiles, concluding that "an exaggeration of the benefits of NMN supplementation may exist in the field" [40]. A 2025 meta-analysis further confirmed minimal benefits for sarcopenia and muscle performance in adults over 60 [41].

**NR (Nicotinamide Riboside).** NR requires an additional enzymatic step (via NRK1/NRK2) compared with NMN to generate NAD+. An RCT in older adults with MCI found that NR (escalated to 1 g/day over 10 weeks) was safe, raised blood NAD+ significantly, and crossed the blood-brain barrier, but did not improve cognition on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (PMC10828186) [42]. A modest NR-associated reduction in epigenetic age (PhenoAge and GrimAge) was observed [42]. A long-COVID RCT (2025) evaluated 2000 mg/day for 24 weeks in 58 participants, published in *Lancet eClinicalMedicine* [43]. A peripheral artery disease pilot (n = 8) showed improved cerebrovascular response [44]. The 2025 consensus assessment is that NMN and NR offer minimal benefits for muscle mass and function in adults over 60 [41].

**CD38 Inhibitors.** CD38 is the primary NADase responsible for the majority of age-related NAD+ decline [37]. Small-molecule CD38 inhibitors (compound 78c and analogs) have reversed age-related NAD+ decline and improved metabolic function in mice [45], but no CD38 inhibitor clinical trials for aging exist as of early 2025. This approach---preserving NAD+ by preventing degradation rather than supplying precursors---is conceptually upstream of NMN/NR but remains preclinical.

**The NAD+ Paradox.** A critical unresolved question is why reliably raising blood NAD+ has not consistently translated into clinical endpoint improvements. This "NAD+ paradox" raises fundamental questions about the NAD+ depletion theory of aging [42]. Possible explanations include inadequate tissue-level NAD+ repletion despite elevated blood levels, compartmentalization of NAD+ metabolism, and the theoretical concern that increased NAD+ could fuel cancer cell metabolism---though NMN and NR also enhance DNA repair and immune surveillance [37].

### 4.4 Metformin

Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide) occupies a unique position in the longevity pharmacopeia: it is the only candidate geroprotective agent with 60+ years of clinical safety data, approximately 150 million current users, and a cost of ~$4/month [46].

**TAME Trial Update.** The Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial (NCT02432287, PI: Nir Barzilai) is a Phase 3 multi-center, double-blind RCT of metformin 1500 mg/day versus placebo in 3,000 non-diabetic adults aged 65--79, with a composite primary endpoint of first cardiovascular event, cancer, dementia, or death over 6 years [47]. Funding of $45--70M is needed; the NIA set aside $5M, and the trial is now handled within the ARPA-H framework. Eli Lilly is planning a TAME-like study incorporating a GLP-1 agonist arm [47]. Completion is estimated at 2027--2028. The regulatory milestone---FDA agreement that aging can be an indication---is arguably the trial's most important contribution to date, regardless of its eventual outcome [47].

**MILES Trial.** The completed MILES pilot (NCT02432287) provided molecular evidence that metformin reverses age-related gene expression changes in muscle and adipose tissue [47].

**Epidemiological Evidence versus RCT Uncertainty.** The widely cited Bannister et al. (2014) observation that diabetics on metformin lived 15% longer than matched non-diabetic controls generated enormous enthusiasm [48]. However, a 2025 critical review in *Ageing Research Reviews* highlighted methodological limitations of this and other early studies, describing "emerging uncertainty on the anti-aging potential of metformin" in non-diabetic populations [49]. In contrast, a 2024 primate study in *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* showed that 3.3 years of metformin treatment in healthy cynomolgus monkeys decreased protein age by 6.41 years and DNA methylation age across five organ systems (-6.1 years frontal lobe, -5.11 years lung, -4.9 years kidney, -3.95 years liver, -2.65 years skin) [50].

**Mechanisms Beyond Glucose Control.** Metformin's proposed geroprotective mechanisms extend well beyond AMPK activation: mTORC1 inhibition, mitochondrial complex I modulation, anti-inflammatory effects (NF-kB, IL-6, TNF-alpha reduction), gut microbiome modulation (*Akkermansia muciniphila* enrichment), epigenetic effects, and anti-senescence activity [46].

**Exercise Blunting Controversy.** The observation that metformin may attenuate exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations and hypertrophic gains remains controversial and may limit enthusiasm for its use in physically active older adults [46].

### 4.5 Epigenetic Reprogramming

Epigenetic reprogramming represents the most radical---and potentially the most potent---approach to aging reversal, premised on the hypothesis that aging is fundamentally an epigenetic process that can be reversed by resetting the epigenome to a younger state without full dedifferentiation [51].

**Yamanaka Factors: OSK in Aged Mice.** Macip et al. (2024) delivered AAV9-encoded doxycycline-inducible OSK (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4---omitting the oncogene c-Myc) to 124-week-old wild-type mice. Cyclic induction produced a 109% increase in median remaining lifespan with improved health condition, alongside profound age reversal in heart and liver as assessed by DNA methylation clocks (PubMed: 38381405) [52]. This is among the most dramatic lifespan extension results ever reported from a pharmacological or genetic intervention.

**Mesenchymal Drift Reversal.** A 2025 *Cell* paper from the Belmonte laboratory revealed that a pervasive "mesenchymal drift" (MD)---upregulation of mesenchymal genes across >40 human tissues---is a fundamental aging phenotype correlating with disease progression and mortality. Transient 1-week OSKM expression suppressed MD through a partial mesenchymal-epithelial transition without activating pluripotency markers (e.g., NANOG) [53].

**Single-Factor Approaches.** Shift Bioscience reported that a novel single-gene target, SB000, achieves methylome and transcriptome rejuvenation comparable to OSKM without activating the pluripotency pathway (bioRxiv, June 2025) [54]. If validated in vivo, this would be transformatively simpler and safer than multi-factor cocktails, though the gene identity remains proprietary and independent replication is pending.

**Chemical Reprogramming Alternatives.** Small-molecule cocktails that mimic Yamanaka factor effects are under investigation as potentially safer approaches, reviewed in *Aging* journal (2024) [55].

**Safety Concerns.** Tumorigenesis risk is the major obstacle. c-Myc is a known oncogene, and even the OSK triad carries risk if expression is not precisely controlled in duration and level [52]. Dedifferentiation concerns---the possibility of losing cell identity---further constrain in vivo application.

**Company Programs.** The commercial landscape is rapidly expanding:

| Company | Funding | Approach | Status (2025) |
|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Altos Labs | $3B (Bezos, Milner, ARCH) | Cellular rejuvenation | Human safety testing from Aug 2025 |
| Retro Biosciences | $180M seed + $1B Series A | Partial reprogramming, autophagy | First human trial (Australia) by end 2025 |
| Turn Biotechnologies | $300M HanAll deal | ERA mRNA-based transient reprogramming | IND-enabling TRN-001, target 2026 |
| Life Biosciences | Multiple rounds | Epigenetic reprogramming (ocular) | Human trials expected early 2026 |
| NewLimit | $105M (Brian Armstrong) | Epigenetic reprogramming | Research stage |
| Shift Bioscience | $16M seed (Oct 2024) | SB000 single-gene; AI virtual cell | SB000 data expected June 2025 |

### 4.6 GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

The emergence of GLP-1 receptor agonists as potential geroprotective agents was not predicted by traditional aging biology frameworks and may represent the most consequential development in longevity pharmacology during 2023--2025.

**Semaglutide and Epigenetic Aging.** In a 32-week RCT of 45 semaglutide-treated and 39 placebo participants with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy (medRxiv 2025), semaglutide significantly decreased multiple epigenetic aging clocks: PCGrimAge (-3.1 years, P = 0.007), GrimAge V1 (-1.4 years, P = 0.02), GrimAge V2 (-2.3 years, P = 0.009), PhenoAge (-4.9 years, P = 0.004), and DunedinPACE (-0.09 units, approximately 9% slower aging pace, P = 0.01) [57]. Eleven organ-system clocks showed concordant decreases, most prominently for inflammation, brain, and heart [57]. The caveat that HIV patients may not be generalizable to healthy populations is significant.

**MACE Reduction.** The SELECT trial (NCT03574597, n = 17,604) demonstrated that semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly reduced MACE by 20% (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.72--0.90, P < 0.001) and all-cause death by 19% (HR 0.81) in overweight/obese adults with established cardiovascular disease but without diabetes [58]. This cardiovascular benefit appears independent of weight loss magnitude, suggesting direct vascular or anti-inflammatory geroprotective mechanisms [58].

**Alzheimer's Disease.** The EVOKE and EVOKE+ Phase 3 trials are testing semaglutide for early Alzheimer's disease, evaluating whether GLP-1 agonism provides neuroprotection beyond metabolic effects [59].

**"Are GLP-1s the First Longevity Drugs?"** A 2025 *Nature Biotechnology* perspective reported on ARDD conference presentations where Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly representatives proposed that GLP-1 receptor agonists may be the first longevity drugs, citing accumulated evidence for benefit across cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and reduced all-cause mortality [60].

**Mechanistic Hypotheses Beyond Weight Loss.** Proposed geroprotective mechanisms include systemic inflammation reduction (CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha), immune cell function modulation, direct CNS effects via brain GLP-1 receptors, and reduction of amyloid plaques and alpha-synuclein aggregates in preclinical Alzheimer's and Parkinson's models [61]. The concern that muscle mass loss accompanying weight loss may be detrimental in older adults requires careful monitoring [62].

---

### 4.7 Mitochondrial-Targeted Therapies

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging that is increasingly amenable to pharmacological intervention [1].

**Urolithin A (Mitopure).** Urolithin A, a gut-microbial metabolite of ellagitannins that activates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, has accumulated one of the most robust clinical evidence bases in the longevity supplement space, with 25+ registered human trials and $50M+ in R&D [63]. A 4-month RCT demonstrated a 12% improvement in hamstring muscle strength at both 500 mg and 1000 mg doses (P = 0.027 and P = 0.029 vs. placebo, respectively) with reduced plasma acylcarnitines and CRP (PMC9133463) [64]. The MitoImmune study (2025, *Nature Aging*) administered 1000 mg/day urolithin A for 4 weeks to 50 adults; treatment expanded naive CD8+ T cells (treatment difference 0.50 pp, P = 0.0437), increased CD8+ fatty acid oxidation capacity (treatment difference 14.72 pp, P = 0.0061), and reduced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta [65]. The CLARITY brain health study (650 participants) is ongoing with completion expected March 2026 [66].

**SS-31/Elamipretide (FORZINITY).** Elamipretide is a mitochondria-targeting tetrapeptide that selectively binds cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, stabilizing cristae structure, reducing ROS generation, and enhancing ATP production [67]. The FDA approved elamipretide as FORZINITY in September 2025 for Barth syndrome under accelerated approval, establishing it as the first FDA-approved mitochondria-targeting peptide therapy [68]. Clinical trials have been conducted across heart failure (PROGRESS-HF), primary mitochondrial myopathy (MMPOWER-3), and age-related macular degeneration (ReCLAIM) [67]. This approval creates a regulatory pathway for broader aging-related applications.

**Mitochondrial Transplantation.** Emerging research on direct mitochondrial transplantation---transferring functional mitochondria to dysfunctional cells---remains at the preclinical stage but represents a conceptually distinct approach to restoring mitochondrial quality [67].

---

### 4.8 Emerging and Novel Interventions

**Taurine.** The 2023 Singh et al. *Science* paper identified taurine deficiency as a driver of aging across species (PMID: 37289866) [69]. Taurine supplementation in mice increased lifespan by 10% (male) to 12% (female); life expectancy at 28 months increased 18--25% (~7--8 human-year equivalents). In *C. elegans*, lifespan extended 10--23%. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected telomerase activity, enhanced mitochondrial function, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging [69]. In humans, lower taurine levels correlated with higher BMI and adverse metabolic profiles; however, no large-scale aging RCTs exist as of early 2025, and 2024 follow-up studies noted large interindividual variation [70].

**GlyNAC (Glycine + N-Acetylcysteine).** The Sekhar laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine has demonstrated that GlyNAC supplementation (glycine 100 mg/kg/day + NAC 100 mg/kg/day) simultaneously corrects multiple aging hallmarks. A 16-week RCT in 24 older adults (n = 12 GlyNAC, n = 12 placebo) found that GlyNAC corrected glutathione deficiency, reduced oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function, lowered inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha), improved insulin resistance, endothelial function, body composition, gait speed, grip strength, cognition, and exercise capacity (PMID: 35975308) [71]. A 36-week pilot showed that 24 weeks of GlyNAC reversed multiple age-associated defects including cognition, but stopping for 12 weeks allowed defects to return, suggesting ongoing supplementation is necessary [72]. Despite remarkably broad effects, all studies remain small; larger confirmatory trials are warranted.

**Spermidine.** Spermidine is among the most potent known autophagy inducers, operating through eIF5A hypusination and EP300/CBP acetyltransferase inhibition [73]. Cognitive effects have been inconsistent: the SmartAge trial (n ~ 100, 12 months) showed trends toward improved memory in some secondary endpoints but no clear primary benefit [74]. The POLYCAD trial randomized 187 elderly patients with coronary artery disease 1:1 to 24 mg/day spermidine or placebo, with co-primary endpoints of left ventricular mass, peak VO2, appendicular lean mass, and hsCRP; recruitment completed August 2025 [75]. A 40 mg/day dose was safe and well-tolerated in healthy older men over 28 days [76].

**Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG).** This TCA cycle metabolite and caloric restriction mimetic reduced biological age by an average of 8 years over 7 months in an open-label pilot of calcium-AKG 1000 mg/day (TruAge DNA methylation clock), though the study lacked a placebo control (n ~ 42) [77]. The ABLE trial in Singapore is enrolling 120 adults aged 40--60 for 1 g sustained-release calcium-AKG over 6 months with 3-month follow-up---one of the most rigorous AKG aging trials to date [78]. A 2025 preclinical study demonstrated that AKG restored long-term potentiation and associative memory in APP/PS1 Alzheimer's model mice [79].

**Gene Therapies.** AAV-Klotho prolonged mouse lifespan by 19.7%, improved bone health, muscle regeneration, and reduced neuroinflammation (*Molecular Therapy*, 2025) [80]. Intranasal AAV-Follistatin extended median mouse lifespan by approximately 30% with improved physical performance (*PNAS*, 2022) [81]. SIRT6 overexpression extended lifespan by 30% in both sexes, preserving hepatic glucose output and promoting de novo NAD+ synthesis (*Nature Communications*, 2021) [82]. A high-throughput screen of >650,000 compounds identified TAC (TERT Activating Compound), which epigenetically de-represses endogenous TERT via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade, promoting telomere synthesis and neurogenesis in aged mice without cancer risk (*Cell*, 2024) [83]. Combined Klotho + Follistatin clinical trials for healthy adults have been initiated, and Minicircle Bio expects Klotho gene therapy to reach clinical stage in 2026 [80].

**Plasma Exchange.** The field is divided between the Alkahest approach (young plasma fractions for neurodegeneration) and the Conboy hypothesis that benefits of heterochronic parabiosis derive primarily from dilution of pro-aging factors rather than positive rejuvenating factors in young blood [84]. Elevian is developing GDF11-based therapies, though controversy persists---some studies show GDF11 hinders rather than promotes muscle regeneration [85]. Lyfspn is planning clinical trials of therapeutic plasmapheresis [84].

**Autophagy Modulators.** AA-20, a novel TFEB-dependent autophagy enhancer, extended *C. elegans* lifespan without mTORC1 inhibition---a critical distinction from rapamycin that may avoid immunosuppressive side effects (*PNAS*, 2025) [86]. Trehalose activates autophagy via TFEB, and SINE compounds (XPO1 inhibitors like selinexor) trap TFEB in the nucleus to enhance autophagic gene transcription [87].

---

### 4.9 Combination and Synergistic Approaches

**Rapamycin + Acarbose.** The 36.6% median lifespan extension achieved by this combination in the ITP remains a benchmark for pharmacological synergy [29]. The rationale is complementary mechanism: mTORC1 inhibition (rapamycin) combined with postprandial glucose blunting (acarbose) addresses both nutrient-sensing and metabolic hallmarks simultaneously.

**Multi-Hallmark Targeting Rationale.** The expanded hallmarks framework [1] implies that maximal geroprotective benefit will require targeting multiple orthogonal pathways. Convergent mechanisms---autophagy (rapamycin, spermidine, urolithin A, AA-20), inflammation (metformin, semaglutide, STING inhibitors), and NAD+ metabolism (NMN, NR, CD38 inhibitors, SIRT6)---suggest logical combination partners [88].

**Biomarker-Guided Polypharmacy.** The emergence of organ-specific proteomic aging profiles [89] and validated epigenetic clocks [90] enables a new paradigm of personalized polypharmacy: selecting interventions based on which hallmarks and organs show the greatest acceleration in individual patients. This remains largely theoretical but is the logical endpoint of current biomarker development.

| Combination | Rationale | Evidence Level |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Rapamycin + acarbose | mTOR + glucose sensing | Preclinical (36.6% lifespan, mice) |
| D+Q (senolytic combo) | Broad senescent cell coverage | Phase 2 clinical |
| Klotho + Follistatin | Anti-aging gene + muscle preservation | Early clinical |
| CD38 inhibitor + NMN/NR | Prevent NAD+ degradation + supply precursor | Preclinical |
| Senolytic + senomorphic | Clear + suppress remaining senescent cells | Conceptual |

## 5. Biomarkers and Aging Clocks

The development of validated biomarkers of biological aging has arguably been as important as the development of interventions themselves, providing the measurement tools without which aging clinical trials cannot be efficiently conducted. The period 2023--2025 has seen the maturation of epigenetic clocks from academic curiosities to clinical trial endpoints, the emergence of multi-omic and AI-powered approaches, and growing---but still incomplete---regulatory acceptance.

---

### 5.1 Epigenetic Clocks

DNA methylation clocks are the most promising tools for biological age estimation among all potential biomarkers studied, with age-related methylation sites constituting approximately 28% of the human genome [90].

**Generation 1: Chronological Age Predictors.** The Horvath multi-tissue clock (2013) uses 353 CpG sites across an elastic net regression model trained on 8,000 samples from 51 cell types, achieving a median absolute error of ~3.6 years [91]. The Hannum blood-based clock (2013) uses 71 CpGs optimized for blood with median absolute error of ~4.9 years [92]. Both predict chronological age rather than biological aging per se; epigenetic age acceleration (EAA = DNAm age minus chronological age) of +5 years is associated with ~15--20% increased mortality risk [91]. Their primary limitation as clinical trial endpoints is relatively low sensitivity to interventions.

**Generation 2: Mortality- and Phenotype-Trained Clocks.** PhenoAge (Levine, 2018) employs a two-step approach: first calculating a composite "phenotypic age" from 9 clinical biomarkers (albumin, creatinine, glucose, CRP, lymphocyte %, mean cell volume, RDW, alkaline phosphatase, WBC count) plus chronological age, then building a 513-CpG methylation predictor of this phenotypic age [93]. PhenoAge acceleration significantly predicts mortality (HR ~1.04--1.05 per year of acceleration) and is substantially superior to first-generation clocks [93].

GrimAge (Lu and Horvath, 2019; GrimAge2, 2022) uses 1,030 CpGs to generate methylation surrogates for 7 plasma proteins (adrenomedullin, beta-2 microglobulin, cystatin C, GDF-15, leptin, PAI-1, TIMP-1) plus smoking pack-years [94]. GrimAge acceleration is the strongest epigenetic predictor of all-cause mortality among all published clocks (HR ~1.07--1.10 per year of acceleration), also strongly predicting coronary heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and COPD [94]. A 2025 NIA review confirmed GrimAge as the best mortality predictor among epigenetic clocks [90]. GrimAge has shown response to caloric restriction (CALERIE trial), weight loss, exercise, and smoking cessation, and is being used as a primary endpoint in the PEARL trial and other longevity trials [94].

**Generation 3: Pace of Aging.** DunedinPACE (Belsky, 2022) represents a conceptual advance: rather than estimating cumulative biological age, it measures the *rate* of aging using 173 CpGs trained on the Dunedin Longitudinal Study---1,037 individuals followed from age 3 to 45 with 19 repeated measures of organ-system function [95]. A DunedinPACE value of 1.0 indicates aging at the normative rate; each 0.1-unit increase is associated with ~10--15% increased mortality risk [95]. Its key advantage is sensitivity to interventions: the CALERIE 2-year caloric restriction trial reduced DunedinPACE by ~2--3% [95]. Framingham Heart Study data demonstrated that DunedinPACE predicts cognitive decline over follow-up [95]. DunedinPACE is increasingly considered the preferred endpoint for shorter aging clinical trials (detecting changes in 6--12 months) [96].

### 5.2 Proteomic and Metabolomic Clocks

**Deep Aging Clocks (DACs).** AI-powered aging clocks that overcome linear model limitations by capturing non-linear complex interactions have been reviewed in *Ageing Research Reviews* (2025) [97]. Deep learning approaches integrate epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, microbiome data, and medical imaging to produce more comprehensive biological age estimates than any single-omic approach [97].

**OMICmAge and SYMPHONYAge.** Multi-omic integration clocks, including TruDiagnostic's OMICmAge, combine DNA methylation with metabolomic and proteomic data to create composite aging estimates [98]. Organ-specific proteomic clocks developed by Oh and Wyss-Coray (2023) identified distinct aging signatures for 11 major organs from plasma proteins, revealing that ~1 in 5 apparently healthy adults aged 50+ had significantly accelerated aging in at least one organ, and that multi-organ accelerated aging conferred ~50% increased mortality risk [89].

### 5.3 Composite Biomarker Panels

Multi-modal approaches combining omic layers with wearable sensor data are emerging as the next frontier. GeroSense, developed by Gero AI, integrates wearable-derived physical activity data with biological markers to estimate both biological age and resilience (the ability to recover from perturbations) [99]. The conceptual shift from static "biological age snapshots" to dynamic "aging trajectory monitoring" parallels the DunedinPACE philosophy of measuring rate rather than state.

Functional biomarkers retain critical importance: gait speed (<0.8 m/s associated with significantly elevated mortality; each 0.1 m/s increase associated with ~12% mortality reduction) [100] and grip strength (each 5 kg decline associated with ~15--20% increased mortality) [101] remain among the strongest single predictors of adverse outcomes in older adults and are accepted by the FDA as functional clinical trial endpoints.

### 5.4 Clinical Utility and Validation Status

**GrimAge versus DunedinPACE: Comparative Performance.** The field consensus is evolving toward using GrimAge/GrimAge2 for longer trials (>12 months) where cumulative biological age change is the target, and DunedinPACE for shorter trials (6--12 months) where detecting changes in the rate of aging is prioritized [96]. In head-to-head comparisons, GrimAge is the stronger mortality predictor in cross-sectional analysis, while DunedinPACE is more responsive to short-term interventions [94, 95].

**Commercial Testing Landscape.**

| Provider | Platform | Key Clocks Reported | Sample Type | Approx. Cost |
|----------|----------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| TruDiagnostic | Illumina EPIC array | Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge2, DunedinPACE, DNAmTL, OMICmAge | Blood | $229--$499 |
| Elysium (Index) | Illumina array | Biological age, rate of aging | Saliva | ~$299 |
| Tally Health | Custom panel | CheekAge (proprietary) | Buccal swab | ~$229 |
| GlycanAge | UPLC glycomics | IgG glycosylation-based immune age | Blood | $299--$399 |

Sources: [98, 102, 103, 104].

A somatic-mutation-driven model of epigenetic aging, published in *Nature Aging* (2025), found that somatic mutations explain over 50% of the variation in methylation age across individuals (Pearson r = 0.67 for mutation clock vs. r = 0.83 for methylation clock in predicting chronological age) [105]. This raises the fundamental question of whether epigenetic clocks measure epigenetic aging per se or downstream consequences of accumulated mutations---with profound implications for whether epigenetic rejuvenation therapies address root causes or symptoms.

### 5.5 Use as Clinical Trial Endpoints

The adoption of aging biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials is accelerating, driven by the impracticality of using lifespan or composite disease endpoints in Phase 2 trials.

**Semaglutide as Proof of Concept.** The HIV trial epigenetic aging data (PCGrimAge -3.1 years, PhenoAge -4.9 years, DunedinPACE -9%) [57] represents the most compelling demonstration to date that a pharmacological intervention can modify validated aging biomarkers in a controlled trial setting. If replicated in healthy populations, this would establish a template for biomarker-driven aging drug development.

**NR and Modest Clock Reduction.** The MCI trial finding of modest PhenoAge and GrimAge reductions with NR supplementation [42]---despite failure to improve cognition---illustrates both the sensitivity of epigenetic clocks and the uncertain relationship between biomarker improvement and clinical benefit.

**Growing Adoption.** The PEARL trial uses GrimAge and DunedinPACE as primary endpoints [27], and the TAME trial includes epigenetic age acceleration as a secondary endpoint [47]. More than a dozen ongoing longevity trials incorporate at least one epigenetic clock measure [96].

| Trial | Clock(s) Used | Role | Finding |
|-------|--------------|------|---------|
| Semaglutide HIV | GrimAge, PhenoAge, DunedinPACE | Exploratory | Significant reductions (P = 0.004--0.01) |
| NR MCI | PhenoAge, GrimAge | Secondary | Modest reductions; no cognitive benefit |
| PEARL (rapamycin) | GrimAge, DunedinPACE | Primary | Results pending |
| TAME (metformin) | GrimAge, DunedinPACE | Secondary | Results pending |
| CALERIE (caloric restriction) | DunedinPACE | Exploratory | ~2--3% pace reduction |

The critical gap remains FDA qualification of an aging biomarker as a validated surrogate endpoint. Until this occurs, longevity trials must continue to rely on composite disease endpoints or functional measures (gait speed, grip strength, SPPB) as primary outcomes, with biological aging clocks providing mechanistic support.
